    <AbstractNarration>The University of Utah Cosmic Ray Physics Group has a long history of studying the spectrum, composition, and sources of the highest energy particles in the universe. The west desert of Utah, where their experiments have been located, is an excellent site for cosmic ray experiments. Their current experiment is the Telescope Array (TA), which is the largest cosmic ray experiment in the northern hemisphere. This group is the host institution of the TA experiment. The physics issues (what is the nature of the sources? and how do they accelerate particles to such high energies?) are among the most important questions in astrophysics today. Measurements of the spectrum and composition of cosmic rays are basic to answering these questions, and searching for anisotropy in their arrival directions is a direct way of identifying sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides the baseline support of the group, covering salaries, travel and data analysis. The goals of the coming three-year grant period include: measuring the cosmic ray spectrum with both surface and fluorescence detectors and making cosmic ray composition studies in stereo and hybrid modes, as well as searching for anisotropy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Broader Impacts, the group's main outreach arm is the ASPIRE Project, which creates and maintains some of the Web's most engaging and interactive science lessons and labs. ASPIRE provides direct outreach to area teachers, runs summer workshops for students, and makes visits to rural schools. The Lon and Mary Watson Cosmic Ray Center (owned by the University of Utah) in Delta, Utah, is the center of the TA outreach work and for the field operations.</AbstractNarration>
