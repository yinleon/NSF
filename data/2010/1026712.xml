    <AbstractNarration>Professor Jason Weaver of the University of Florida in the US and Professor Marcus Bäumer of the University of Bremen in Germany seek to advance the basic understanding of the selectivity of rare earth oxides (REOs) toward partial vs. complete oxidation reactions and to explore methods for tuning the catalytic selectivity of REOs through alkali-doping and nanoscale size effects. This research will employ a combined approach that involves model studies of pure and alkali-doped REO thin films in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and characterization of REO nanoparticles under more realistic reactive conditions, with the aim of establishing clear bridges in understanding across the materials and pressure divides. The involvement of multiple investigators with broad experience in surface science and catalysis research will enable the application of a large suite of analysis methods for characterization of materials and surface chemistries in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and ambient conditions, including the use of novel, plasma-based methods for growing oxides in UHV for fundamental studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division supports Professor Jason Weaver of the University of Texas- Austin in the US, whose research will provide new insights for improving the performance of REO catalysts used for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). The German funding agency, DFG, will support the work of the international collaborator, Professor Marcus Bäumer of the University of Bremen. The development of industrially-feasible routes for directly transforming methane to higher hydrocarbons could have significant economic and environmental benefits. The proposed project provides a unique opportunity to enhance the educational experiences of the students and principle investigators (PIs). The students will gain a much broader set of technical skills than they would by working at a single institution, and they will develop strong communication skills from the exchange of ideas among the research groups. Through involvement in a minority student mentoring program, Professor Weaver also plans to recruit undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to work on this project. One of the co-PIs will continue her work directing a mentoring program for female graduate students in chemical engineering.</AbstractNarration>
