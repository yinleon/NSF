    <AbstractNarration>A partnership of research scientists, science educators and supporters of science-based conservation are developing mechanisms to engage middle school students and educators from a major urban region in geosciences research with advanced sampling and sensing platforms. The collective science and education strengths of Rutgers University, the N.J. Marine Sciences Consortium/N.J. Sea Grant College Program, Brookdale Community College, the National Park Service, and the Sandy Hook Foundation -- a nongovernmental organization, constitute the backbone of a partnership that is incorporating real-world geoscience programs into formal and informal science curricula and activities at the Red Bank Middle School. The school is revamping its science curricula to align it with the new state science standards which were just revised to include the Earth sciences. The partnership is developing educational strategies to incorporate real-world science and technology into the new curricula with an emphasis on inquiry-based learning, integrated science topics, and the inclusion of technology. Educational strategies also are being developed to enrich after school programs and enhance science content for field programs delivered at the Sandy Hook Unit of the Gateway National Recreation Area, National Park Service.</AbstractNarration>
