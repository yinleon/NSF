    <AbstractNarration>This project at Chief Dull Knife Memorial College (CDKC) is founded on a desire to expand participation of undergraduate students in research at an early stage of their mathematical development. However, existing developmental mathematics courses provide students with computational skills but little expertise with problem solving, representation, data handling, or graphical interpretation. To acquaint all developmental students with the utility of mathematics and science, and promote the acquisition of applicable research skills, this project is developing six contextual research skills modules. The development of these modules is guided by an advisory board of nationally recognized researchers and two development teams, each consisting of university faculty, instructors, and an advanced student. Each module is embedded in an authentic and locally relevant research context, with effectiveness established through a cyclic and collaborative process of development, implementation, evaluation, and revision. Simultaneously, evaluation efforts examine the factors that influence developmental students' career and educational choices. Overall, the project is part of an effort to restructure developmental mathematics at CDKC while retaining the focus on core skills, yet infusing developmental courses with contextual experiences that are applicable to undergraduate research in a variety of academic areas.</AbstractNarration>
