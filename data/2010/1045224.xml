    <AbstractNarration>This project will survey the insects that belong to the families Tabanidae (horse flies, etc.) and Ceratopogonidae (biting midges) that use Louisiana tidal marshes. The larvae of both families of flies prey upon invertebrates in tidal marshes, and adult reproduction is dependent upon the vertebrate hosts that reside above the larval habitats. Therefore, these flies will serve as excellent bioindicators for wetland health. The impact and recovery related to oil contamination will be evaluated via comparative analyses of data on population size, species diversity, and genetic diversity of flies collected in tidal marsh areas that are contaminated as well as sites that are not contaminated. The studies will show which areas have been affected by the spill, and identify areas needing mitigation and rehabilitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The oil spill is likely to impact communities that border the Gulf and potentially even the Atlantic Ocean. Therefore, surveillance of these insects could be an important element used in future rapid assessment efforts. Collaboration with scientists from other coastal states will be established to foster development of future assessment efforts. Both graduate and undergraduate students would be involved and benefit from participation in these studies, which should provide a new role for entomology in coastal studies.</AbstractNarration>
