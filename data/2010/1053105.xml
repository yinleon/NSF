    <AbstractNarration>Computer vision started with the goal of building machines that can see like humans. Nowadays, computer vision has expended to numerous applications such as image database search in the world wide web, computational photography, reconstruction of three-dimensional scenes, surveillance, assistive systems, vision for graphics and nanotechnology, etc. More domains and applications keep arising as computer vision technology develops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The goal of the workshop in Frontiers in Computer Vision is to bring together national and international experts, from academia and industry, to identify the future impact of computer vision on the economic, social, educational and security needs of the nation and outline the scientific and technological challenges to address the issues: how can computer vision build on the success and enthusiasm of its growing participants? how can the academic community make connections to industry? how to better foster scholarship and improve communication both within computer vision itself and to related disciplines and application areas? How can computer vision best interact with related fields? how can the importance and promise of computer vision be communicated to the general public? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deliverables of the event include, among others, videos of the presentations available on the Frontiers in Computer Vision website, together with a roadmap to outline the scientific and technological challenges to address.</AbstractNarration>
