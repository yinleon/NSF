    <AbstractNarration>This research project, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, will develop methods for activating C-H bonds and for forming C-C bonds based on facile interconversions of platinum(II) and platinum(IV) organometallic complexes. Professor Joseph L. Templeton of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will develop methods for forming C-C bonds from abundant and recalcitrant C-H bonds in alkane and arene reagents. Activation of C-H bonds and formation of C-C bonds will be promoted by controlling access to reactive five-coordinate platinum intermediates. Experiments to elucidate the mechanism of organometallic platinum reaction cycles will be undertaken. Although significant progress has been made in both C-H activation and C-C bond formation reactions, most of the focus has been on the details of the organic bonds as they reshuffle partners. This project will look at the critical role of ancillary ligands on the metal that remain intact throughout the reaction cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work could lead to more efficient methods of carbon-carbon bond formation through both insertion reactions and coupling mechanisms. Chemical transformations promoted with transition metals are environmentally beneficial since the reactions are economical with respect to atomic identity of reagents and products. This methodology will have an impact on areas that rely on the efficient preparation of chemicals within the pharmaceutical, chemical, and agricultural industries. Broader impacts include expanding the education of both undergraduate and graduate students through independent experimental research projects. In addition, Professor Templeton will participate in advisory activities that promote science not only on the Chapel Hill campus but across the state of North Carolina.</AbstractNarration>
