    <AbstractNarration>The engineering physics program enrolls 40 majors and additional minors, and the numbers are increasing. The program became focused on engineering physics four years ago and has a strong applied physics component, with cutting edge courses offered by faculty with excellent preparation and expertise. The program maintains reciprocal agreements with a local community college and New Jersey Institute of Technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to further develop the Ramapo College physics program, especially in undergraduate research. This project is adding a laboratory in Medical Physics dedicated to the Medical Physics course, a growing area of interest. The goal of the laboratory is to create hands-on skills in the particular field of applied physics, to enhance students' understanding of the topic, and to create research opportunities at the undergraduate level for juniors and seniors. The laboratory is helping to create opportunities for faculty and students to do cutting-edge physics and strengthen the engineering physics curriculum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project consists of the development of new laboratory curriculum components in the fields of Medical Physics. This laboratory is unique for the public colleges of the state of NJ at the undergraduate level. The new laboratory environment fosters faculty development and faculty-guided undergraduate research in new areas of science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Broader Impacts: By creating the needed research and laboratory environments, this project addresses the nationwide problem that students have too little experience with frontier physics topics. Findings are being disseminated through physics education and research papers and presentations at national and international conferences. At yearly meetings with the Council of Liberal Arts Colleges (COPLAC), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the project is reaching four-year colleges and engaging them in a conversation about similar engineering physics curricula. Locally, the project is collaborating with Rockland Community College as well as New Jersey Institute of Technology, to offer laboratory and course offerings to their physics and engineering students.</AbstractNarration>
