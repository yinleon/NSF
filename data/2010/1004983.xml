    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Sankaran Thayumanavan and Justin T. Fermann at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst. The site will have support for three summers, commencing in 2010. The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program. The site is named: "Collaborative Undergraduate Research in Energy," and focuses on interdisciplinary chemistry research with a focus on fundamental research with an impact in next-generation renewable energy technologies. Sample projects include: (1) the use of a biological proton transporter as an element in a proton-selective membrane; (2) the development of photovoltaic materials through template electrodeposition; (3) the synthesis and study of new kinds of polymer electrolyte membranes for use in fuel cells; (4) the modeling and characterization of mesoscale structures in proton conducting materials ; (5) the development and study of new molecular sieve catalysts for the production of renewable fuels; and (6) the study of the environmental fate and bioavailability of quantum dots used in solar cells (nano environmental health and safety); In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities. Students will also participate in an outreach activity to either the Springfield Museum or the Boston Museum of Science. Students will be recruited from a large number of institutions across the country, including a number of schools that are minority-serving. In addition, significant numbers of women will be recruited from regional women's colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training. This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in the chemical sciences to a significant number of students who might not otherwise have this opportunity. The research projects are in areas of chemistry that will have an impact in the areas of energy and sustainability. The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>
