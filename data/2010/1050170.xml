    <AbstractNarration>Enterprise applications are increasingly being migrated to the cloud. The central challenge in cloud-based enterprise operations is ensuring that enterprises can control key aspects of their communication such as security and performance, and service providers can offer the right primitives to meet customer requirements. The proposed CloudNet framework will optimally accommodate diverse needs of both enterprises and cloud providers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project leverages a large GENI-based experimentation framework. Cloud providers, WAN, enterprise servers and clients are mapped to campus OpenFlow networks, Internet2 and Supercharged PlanetLab, PlanetLab and the CMULab wireless emulator, respectively. The experiment explores the effectiveness and trade-offs of key techniques in CloudNet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the proposed research include enabling sophisticated enterprise applications that offer a rich user experience while also accounting for performance, security and privacy. The proposed work will highlight how providers can build rich cloud-based services. The research will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate curricula.</AbstractNarration>
