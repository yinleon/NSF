    <AbstractNarration>The ELF (Experiential Learning Fellowship) program is providing financial resources to increase the number of students successfully completing undergraduate and graduate degrees in STEM disciplines while also civically engaging them in relevant science service within their community. The scholarship support provides the financial means to finish their academic career while also providing time and access to an unparalleled learning experience and timely mentors for research. The program encourages cross-disciplinary interaction between students and faculty during the earliest academic years and strongly promotes peer learning and mentorship across the academic spectrum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participating scholars are first introduced to research by means of seminars, field trips to community research and development sites, and laboratory visits within the university. Subsequently many scholars choose to join a community service research team and participate in the investigative process. After making progress on research goals, the teams cooperatively work toward an in-depth report of their findings and make oral and written presentations to all interested parties. When appropriate, the findings are presented at conferences and submitted to peer-reviewed publications for dissemination. In addition to increasing student learning and retention, the ELF Program has the broadening impact of building bridges between the local community and university. This fosters better relationships between the two entities and facilitates the recruitment of minority and first generation students to the university and STEM disciplines. The interactive research experience of these funded scholars is highly sought by potential future employers.</AbstractNarration>
