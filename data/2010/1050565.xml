    <AbstractNarration>This study will examine the physiological and evolutionary responses to the Gulf of Mexico oil leak of a small crustacean, the copepod Eurytemora affinis. This species is a dominant member of coastal ecosystems, especially those in the Gulf of Mexico. This project will address the following questions: (1) How quickly and to what extent can organisms evolve in response to the toxic effects of crude oil? (2) Which traits evolve in response to crude oil exposure? (3) Do different populations (independently-derived selected lines, and populations from different locations in the field) respond in a similar manner? (4) Is there a cost to adaptation to the toxic effects of crude oil? It will accomplish these goals by conducting a laboratory selection and comparing those reponses to evolutionary changes in Gulf populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding evolutionary responses is essential for determining the long-term survival and recovery of the impacted populations, given the acute toxicity of crude oil. Beyond the copepods, the results of this study will provide critical information for understanding responses in other gulf species. The project will also result in the training of two graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
