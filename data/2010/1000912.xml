    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to elucidate the fundamental behavior of novel lubricants composed of chalcogenide nanoparticles with and without integrated functional organic molecules. Via the use of experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, research tasks are designed to explore size- and chemistry-dependent properties of MoS2 nanoparticles, including critical analyses of defect behavior in crystalline MoS2 and the nature of integration between MoS2 nanoparticles and organic molecular chains used for functionalization. Simulations will be used to investigate the nucleation, motion and interaction of defects in crystalline MoS2 during mechanical shearing or compression. Experiments will be performed to evaluate the tribological performance of the nanostructured lubricants, with particular focus on harsh boundary lubrication conditions over load and temperature ranges representative of key applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Friction is one of the primary reasons for inefficiency and failure of structural components in engines and heavy machinery (including mining equipment and wind turbines). The novel nanoparticle-based lubricants explored in this work will address a major need of US manufacturing industries by providing predictable and extended reliability along with major energy savings in severe friction and wear conditions. This research is integrated with education and outreach activities specifically aimed at young researchers through participation in REU programs and science teachers in collaboration with a local school district. Discoveries made during this research regarding integration between organic and inorganic structures at the nanoscale will also benefit other key nanomaterial-focused industries, such as bio-fuel, bio-manufacturing and pharmaceuticals.</AbstractNarration>
