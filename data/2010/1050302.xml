    <AbstractNarration>As the scale of data has grown from the order of megabytes to the order of petabytes, energy and power have become a key consideration in managing (i.e., analyzing, organizing, and storing) such large datasets due to the increasing cost of powering the required data processing resources and cooling equipment. It is expected that the demand for data processing resources, both in the form of servers and mobile computing devices, will continue to increase exponentially. The goal of this two-day workshop is to act as a planning meeting for the development and deployment of energy-efficient data management methods and data-intensive applications which are important from both an economic and a sustainability perspective. The workshop includes invited talks, panels and breakout sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the workshop is expected to be in terms of guiding future research which will provide a more sustainable way of managing society's increasing and rapidly growing reliance on large data management systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information on the workshop can be found at www.energy-efficient-data-management.org/workshop.</AbstractNarration>
