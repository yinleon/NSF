    <AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the University of Massachusetts Boston to manage, in collaboration with the BIO REU Leadership Committee, the BIO REU Travel Scholarship program. Travel scholarships will be provided to students who have participated in the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, especially those programs funded or co-funded by the NSF Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO). These travel scholarships will ensure that students experience the full scope of "doing science" by affording them the opportunity to present their work to their scientific peers. The goal of the Travel Scholarship Program is to provide financial assistance to undergraduate researchers to enable them to present their work at a national scientific meeting. Students will apply for funds on-line at http://www.bioreu.org. A committee of REU mentors will review the applications, which include the student's abstract of the research, letters of recommendation from the research mentors and/or REU site directors, and an essay on the anticipated professional development outcomes of attendance and presentation. Awards will be based on the application and the potential impact of the travel scholarship on the student's career, with priority given to participants of BIO funded or co-funded REU programs. Selected papers will be featured in the http://www.bioreu.org website in order to communicate the results of the research to the broader scientific community and the public. This project will assess the impacts of the activity on the students' career choice. Additional information is available at http://www.bioreu.org or by contacting Dr. Robyn Hannigan (Robyn.Hannigan@umb.edu).</AbstractNarration>
