    <AbstractNarration>Systematic methodologies for the design of distributed and implementable routing and scheduling algorithms that enable one to design, provision and manage mobile wireless networks with predictable and controllable performance are lacking. The research project provides a new framework for modular cross-layer design of scheduling and routing algorithms for ad-hoc networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clique based methods are used for scheduling, where cliques are defined in the interference graph. Clique based policies are developed to achieve optimal throughput and as basis for distributed implementable algorithms for scheduling. Clique based scheduling is easier and more flexible and provides a pathway to extend Network Calculus results, to provide deterministic performance bounds for wireless networks. For the routing, a component based design model is used that divides the routing protocol into components with separate design concerns. Stability, agility and flexibility are better achieved through a component based architecture. These solutions are still cross-layer, but they have well defined interfaces for signaling, control and information exchange between components and layers. Performance models provide a systematic methodology to study and quantify the relationship and sensitivity of the network performance to its components parameters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will yield new principles and fundamental methodologies for the design, performance evaluation, and control of multi-hop wireless networks. Research results will be incorporated in communication, optimization and design courses at the graduate level. The results will be disseminated to industry and Government Labs. Validation and testing will be accomplished via emulation and real life wireless network testbeds in collaboration with industry and Government Labs.</AbstractNarration>
