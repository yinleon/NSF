    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to determine the genetic structure of an important fungal pathogen in the genus Colletotrichum, which infects wild and cultivated cranberries and related plant species throughout North America. This fungus is comprised of two evolutionary clades; one group is widespread and has been recognized as a pathogen of cranberry for more than a century while the other is an emerging disease. This research will examine how features of the ecological landscape interact with gene flow among wild and cultivated cranberry bogs, to shape the evolution and mode of reproduction of this pathogen at multiple spatial scales. The fungus is capable of reproducing both sexually and clonally and known to employ different reproductive strategies in different populations. Clonal populations have the ability to spread rapidly under favorable conditions while sexual populations tend to be more genetically diverse, and thus have a greater adaptive potential in the face of environmental perturbations. Therefore, understanding the reproductive strategy of this pathogen and its dependence on landscape features provides general insight into how emergent diseases may spread. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has important implications for the development of effective management tools that will assist in mitigating significant economic losses caused by this pathogen on cranberry farms. A molecular marker system developed as part of this project will facilitate other research on the evolution, systematics and disease ecology of this fungus. This project will also support the training of high school students in molecular and fungal biology. The project strengthens a collaborative relationship between two research institutions, the P.E. Marucci Center for Blueberry and Cranberry Research and the New York Botanical Garden.</AbstractNarration>
