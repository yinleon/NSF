    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is poised to introduce superior electrolytes to the lithium-ion batteries by using a new class of low-cost, high-performance lithium salts. Currently, the cost of batteries is impacted not only by the high cost of the lithium salts, but also their relatively lower stability that limits battery lifetime. If successful, these electrolytes, to be developed under this Phase II project, will possess higher ionic conductivity and superior thermal and electrochemical properties that will be very attractive particularly for full size lithium-ion batteries applicable to electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles (EV/HEV). Building on the company's earlier success in developing a novel two-step synthetic strategy to prepare these salts which contain two lithium ions versus one in currently used salts, this project will optimize and scale up the synthetic process leading to the production of these salts at much lower cost, while meeting all principal specifications, including high transference number, an attractive property of a battery to function properly at subzero temperatures. This project will also further explore synthetic approaches to deliver even lower cost to capture the small size lithium battery market, where the applications are in computers, cell phones, cameras, and medical devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be in the area of the rechargeable battery industry, especially in the arena of EV/HEV. Cost, performance and battery life are major drivers of this industry. The availability of electrolytes of lower cost, high performance and enhanced stability will contribute to cost reduction needed to make battery driven applications more affordable to users. The successful outcomes of this project are expected to contribute to the US Government's emphasis on renewable energy and particularly, the Department of Energy's roadmap on advanced batteries with more robust and stable chemistries and cost effectiveness.</AbstractNarration>
