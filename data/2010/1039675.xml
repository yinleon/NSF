    <AbstractNarration>Technical Summary: Optical excitation of electron spin coherence in nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers is currently being explored for building solid-state optical devices for quantum information processing. This is possible due to the long coherence time of spin in the NV color centers in diamond. Optical systems that can address isolated electron spins in individual color centers and color center ensembles are significantly important for quantum information storage, entanglement generation, and single photon nonlinear interaction. In this project, the team plans to develop an instrument that will interface color centers in diamond nanocrystals with laser excitations to study quantum phenomena both at room and low (~70K) temperatures. In addition to a confocal optical system, a subsystem consisting of tapered fiber-coupled nanocrystals will be used. This takes advantage of the wave guiding property of tapered fibers to optically address the color center ensemble. Both of these instruments will provide single photon detection and measurement capabilities for doing quantum measurements. These will be used to explore coherence properties of nanocrystals for quantum information storage/retrieval, and single photon nonlinear interactions. The instruments will be extensively used in research-related education and training for a large number of underrepresented minority students engaged in STEM research at Delaware State University. The instruments will also be used in extending advanced physics, material science and quantum optics laboratory experiences for undergraduate and graduate students in the Physics &amp; Pre-Engineering department. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layman Summary: Nitrogen vacancy color centers in diamond are generally considered as defects. Laser excitation of electron spins in a nitrogen vacancy in crystalline diamond exhibits quantum phenomena. This is promising to build solid-state devices for quantum information processing and communication. Single nitrogen vacancy defects can easily be formed in diamond nanocrystals as opposed to a bulk diamond sample. In this project, the team plans to develop instruments that can interface a single as well as a collection of individual nitrogen vacancy defects with laser excitation to build quantum systems. These instruments will be equipped with single photon detection and measurement capabilities to perform quantum measurements. As a specific goal, the team will demonstrate a quantum memory using these instruments as an integral quantum subsystem. Additionally, the instruments will be extensively used to provide research training and education to a large number of underrepresented undergraduate and graduate minority students at Delaware State University. The team plans to incorporate the instruments with several laboratory sessions in graduate courses in Optics. The effort will combine research with broad educational activities involving students and will significantly impact physics and optics-related education at Delaware State.</AbstractNarration>
