    <AbstractNarration>This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place during June 2011 at the National Center for High Technology (CeNAT) in San Jose, Costa Rica. Organized by Dr. David Gracias of the John Hopkins University, the PASI will address research in scalable, functional nanomaterials with topics that range from self-assembly photonic and electronic materials to self-organizing DNA structures. The list of lecturers is extensive and harbors complementary research interests that will provide a broad overview of current efforts in nanomaterials science. Of clear relevance, careful thought has been given to what topics and materials can be translated into practice in countries that do not have extensive research budgets. &lt;br/&gt;Scientific research on nanoscale phenomena has enlivened virtually all science and engineering disciplines over the last twenty years. The intended impact of the PASI is to bring a younger generation of scientists into contact with exciting areas of modern nanoscience that fit within the budget and facilities constraints of many middle income countries. Lectures are complemented with demonstrations, informal discussions and posters on student research. Recruiting targets include graduate students, and post-docs from throughout the Americas (North, Central and South). Moreover, students will become acquainted with successful scientists from a broad range of institutions and a wide range of countries. In addition, the PASI is expected to generate new collaborations throughout the Americas. Results from the PASI will be disseminated through websites for educational purposes with links, updates and presentations.</AbstractNarration>
