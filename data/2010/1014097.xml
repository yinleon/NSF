    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop an new methodology for the deposition of large-scale uniform and complex shape memory alloy parts. Current deposition methods cannot generate the uniform chemical composition, or the three dimensional geometric complexity, that is required for commercially relevant parts. In addition, the cost of current methods to manufacture TiNi, a key thin film shape memory alloy, is too high, limiting commercial acceptance. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of TiNi offers a means to manufacture geometrically complex parts inexpensively. In Phase I, our team will characterize a novel CVD process and characterize the resultant manufactured parts in terms of chemical composition, chemical uniformity, and contamination levels. This data will enable a transition to manufacturing of commercial shape memory devices in Phase II.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a new fabrication methodology that will allow for a dramatic reduction in the cost of thin film TiNi sheet products, stents, and open celled foams, by providing a means to manufacture highly consistent, uniform articles in a batch production process. For highly geometrically complex forms, such as high porosity open celled foams, this CVD process is an enabling manufacturing technology. Successful development of this process will revolutionize the thin film TiNi industry by finally supplying products to the marketplace with the required quality and batch-to-batch consistency for wide commercial acceptance.</AbstractNarration>
