    <AbstractNarration>The Eastern Washington University (EWU) NSF ADVANCE Institutional Transformation (IT) Catalyst will investigate reasons associated with institutional gender inequities and plan effective remedies. Specifically, planned activities include: 1) Identification and review of policies relevant to the recruitment, retention, and promotion of faculty along with consideration of areas in which policy is silent; 2) Administration of a climate survey to faculty in all ranks and positions at EWU; 3) Interview of female faculty currently in STEM disciplines using Sense-Making Methodology (SMM) to better understand the unspoken challenges facing female faculty; 4) Survey of all individuals who applied for faculty positions at EWU within the previous three years to evaluate the inclusiveness and attractiveness of recruitment strategies and processes; 5) Analysis of the distribution, timing, and marketing practices associated with faculty position advertisements as well as the application screening process before and after the initiation of the new recruitment practice; 6) Comparison of the representativeness of gender, diversity, and disability in final applicant selection pools; 7) Focused interviews with department chairs in CSHE and CSBS regarding tangible and intangible incentives, practices, and expectations; 8) Orchestration of town hall meetings with faculty to solicit ideas as well as energize individuals for institutional evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project utilizes sense-making methodologies as a means of extracting qualitative data regarding institutional culture. This reflects an important step for having an in-depth understanding of the factors that attract and support women faculty in the STEM fields. Collected data will complement that already available by giving a more complete picture of issues faced by women faculty. Furthermore, it will allow other universities in Washington and elsewhere with a similar mission and make-up to have a baseline understanding of the core factors impacting women and stimulate transformative endeavors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: EWU will be the first regional comprehensive, primarily undergraduate, teaching-focused university to receive ADVANCE support in Washington. As such, this institution will serve as a model for the Higher Education Coordinating Board and other institutions in Washington and the country as whole. It is anticipated that from this there will be an indirect impact on women students in the STEM fields as they pursue graduate programs and the workforce. Strategies utilized for data gathering have the potential to impact other research processes and continue to strengthen pursuits for equity.</AbstractNarration>
