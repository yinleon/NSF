    <AbstractNarration>ECONOMICS OF A LIGHT BULB: EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE ON CFLS AND END-USER BEHAVIOR &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eliana Carranza and Robyn Meeks &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Residential access to modern energy and lighting is considered to be important for development as &lt;br/&gt;it improves living standards and productivity. However, developing countries can face severe &lt;br/&gt;constraints on available electricity. As a consequence, residential electricity use is limited and &lt;br/&gt;households pay prices that can be as high as those observed in wealthier nations. In the developing &lt;br/&gt;world, where lighting is a major component of residential electricity consumption, energy efficient &lt;br/&gt;technologies such as compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) can offer electricity savings and allow more &lt;br/&gt;energy services. Still, where CFLs have been introduced in developing countries through mass &lt;br/&gt;replacement programs at a zero or subsidized price, their use is often discontinued once the &lt;br/&gt;consumer is required to pay the full price. This represents a major constraint to realizing the &lt;br/&gt;potential impacts of energy efficient lighting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To better understand the adoption, continued use, and diffusion process of the CFL technology, this &lt;br/&gt;study uses randomized experiments to inspect two major mechanisms: (1) the ?rebound? effect, &lt;br/&gt;which is the result of behavioral responses that boost consumption and offset CFLs? technologically &lt;br/&gt;feasible electricity savings, and (2) the role of ?peer? networks in spreading information on a new &lt;br/&gt;technology. Although the initial adoption of CFLs may be limited because the willingness to pay &lt;br/&gt;(WTP) is lower than the market price, their diffusion may be restricted if information is too noisy or &lt;br/&gt;if a greater importance is put on negative rather than positive information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study furthers knowledge on the behavioral barriers that arise from end-user interactions with &lt;br/&gt;energy-efficient technologies. The findings are relevant to several aspects of energy conservation &lt;br/&gt;policy. Examination of the rebound will inform the optimal combination of innovation and price &lt;br/&gt;policies and the trade-off between welfare and electricity conservation. Examination of peer-&lt;br/&gt;networks will discern between different learning mechanisms and tell how best to advance CFLs? &lt;br/&gt;diffusion. Lastly, WTP studies assist in developing strategies for optimal pricing and subsidies. &lt;br/&gt;Beyond the policy relevance for CFL programs deployed recently in developing countries, lessons &lt;br/&gt;learned regarding responses to energy efficient technologies have behavioral implications that are &lt;br/&gt;also relevant to developed countries.</AbstractNarration>
