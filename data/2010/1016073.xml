    <AbstractNarration>This project will focus on the development and analysis of numerical methods &lt;br/&gt;to probe the complex energy landscapes related to various interface and defect &lt;br/&gt;problems, such as microstructures in materials undergoing phase transitions, &lt;br/&gt;quantized vortices in geometrically frustrated configurations, and so on. &lt;br/&gt;The associated stochastic dynamics and hydrodynamics, as well as their &lt;br/&gt;numerical approximations will also be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;He will also study robust and adaptive algorithms that are useful in the &lt;br/&gt;statistical analysis of the underlying structures and important features. &lt;br/&gt;These research issues, on one hand, are driven by practical applications &lt;br/&gt;through collaborations with other scientists, and on the other hand, also &lt;br/&gt;motivate new studies of mathematical subjects ranging from geometry and &lt;br/&gt;topology to numerical and stochastic analysis. The research to be carried out is of interdisciplinary nature, encompassing subjects like computational mathematics, physics, information, materials and biological sciences. &lt;br/&gt;There are many mathematical and numerical challenges involved in the research &lt;br/&gt;such as the understanding of the collective behaviors of families and paths of &lt;br/&gt;solutions of nonlinear PDEs and stochastic dynamics, and the exploration of &lt;br/&gt;the hidden structures and statistics in the simulated results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research on the algorithmic development and numerical simulations can help &lt;br/&gt;enhancing the capability as well as the predictive power of scientific &lt;br/&gt;computations, which has potentially significant scientific, social and &lt;br/&gt;economic impact and is one of the top research priorities internationally. &lt;br/&gt;Meanwhile, interfaces and defects are also ubiquitous in nature which play &lt;br/&gt;fundamental roles in many aspects of physical and biological systems. A better &lt;br/&gt;mathematical and computational understanding of interfaces and defects, &lt;br/&gt;especially in a stochastic setting, will enrich the scientific knowledge base, which in turn may aid the efforts by physicists, materials scientists and engineers in discovering new materials with desirable properties and in &lt;br/&gt;developing new scientific devices and commercial instruments. This project &lt;br/&gt;will also provide valuable interdisciplinary research opportunities for the &lt;br/&gt;future generation of workforce and researchers. With an emphasis on the TEAMS &lt;br/&gt;(Training in Experiments, Analysis, Modeling and Simulations) spirit, young &lt;br/&gt;students can be better prepared to conduct interdisciplinary research in their &lt;br/&gt;career.</AbstractNarration>
