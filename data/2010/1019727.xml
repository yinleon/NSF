    <AbstractNarration>Project Title: Biased Evolutionary Transitions in Mode of Development: Can Differences in Morphology and Digestive Function be Linked to Evolvability of gastropod Development?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Collin, Rachel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Project Number: IOS 1019727 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For over 100 years it has been thought that the loss of complex morphological structures or functions, like the loss of legs in whales and the loss of flight in ostriches, is irreversible. However, recent results suggest that some kinds of animals can regain lost structures or functions. One example of this is in a family of sea snails. In about 50% of these snails the free-living larval stage has been lost, but surprisingly it has been regained in 3 species. This research will use biomechanical, morphological and developmental approaches to understand how the larval structures and their function are lost, and if the different ways they are lost can either prevent or allow the reacquisition of the larval stage. Results will include detailed understanding of how the larvae of these snails capture particles from the plankton, how their ability to digest different food sources develops as the embryonic snails grow, and if simple laboratory manipulations can alter how they develop. Understanding the factors that affect the development of marine animals is important because the larval stage increases the ability of populations to survive local disturbances and relocate after habitat destruction. It also reduces the chances of extinction relative to species that lack the larval stage. Finally the presence of a free-living larval stage also increases the potential for species to become invasive pests. This project will train 3 undergraduate interns, 2 graduate students and one post-doctoral fellow, support an advanced undergraduate-level course, and produce a series of short educational videos provided to the public on YouTube.</AbstractNarration>
