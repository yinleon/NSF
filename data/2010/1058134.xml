    <AbstractNarration>Funds are awarded to carry out a baseline assessment of the impacts on the ecology of the Gulf Coast marshes resulting from BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. The associated coastal wetlands, estuaries and lagoon systems of the Gulf Coast are an irreplaceable national resource and comprise a unique suite of ecosystems of rich biodiversity and widely recognized ecological and economic value. Because of the toxicity of all weights of crude oil there is the potential for smothering, significant injury and mortality of the tidal wetlands. This RAPID project will address a number of critical scientific questions about the impact of this environmental disaster on the ecosystems of the Gulf including: quantifying the extent of the spill, ecological consequences, and environmental factors that contributed. The project will focus on the application of innovative and unique algorithms and computer programs to convert hyperspectral data from the Advanced Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer into measurements of coast marsh vegetation functional types and species; map species/functional type; estimate density of vegetation; evaluate evidence of vegetation stress by comparing contaminated vs. uncontaminated vegetation; and map the location of oil contamination in the wetlands. The research will be valuable to state and federal resource managers, policy makers, and citizens of the region. The data will establish a baseline to measure the longer term consequences to the oil spill.</AbstractNarration>
