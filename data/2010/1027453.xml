    <AbstractNarration>Juveniles of many organisms have a remarkable ability to regenerate their body parts until the adult-specific stem cells begin to develop. The goal of this research is to investigate the mechanism of leg regeneration in insects and how the adult-specific stem cells begin to develop. Using the flour beetle as a model system, how these adult-specific stem cells develop in juveniles will be investigated by removing the expression of various proteins using a molecular technique called RNA interference. Furthermore, genes expressed during leg regeneration will be examined and characterized to identify factors involved in this process. The evolutionary origin of adult-specific stem cells has important implications in understanding a major contentious issue, the origin of insect metamorphosis. Identification of regeneration mechanisms conserved across the animal kingdom will provide insights into the fundamental and essential mechanisms underlying limb regeneration. The study will be conducted at Wellesley College, an undergraduate institution for women from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds, and will actively involve undergraduate students from various backgrounds to provide them with an interdisciplinary research experience and training in modern molecular technology. Experience in multidisciplinary approaches to biology is critical for future scientists, and this study will provide students with such an opportunity. The proposed research will also be brought into the classroom to expose more students to research. The students will be encouraged to both publish their findings and present their work at scientific meetings.</AbstractNarration>
