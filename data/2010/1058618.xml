    <AbstractNarration>With this project, the Chemical Synthesis Program is funding Professor Barbara Zajc of the Department of Chemistry at City College of The City University of New York to further develop methodology toward the regiospecific installation of vinylic fluoride functionality in diverse molecular settings. Such studies are of fundamental interest to the fields of bioorganic and medicinal chemistry, owing to the value of fluorinated functionality, particularly in enhancing metabolic stability and permitting molecular tracing and imaging, by NMR and PET-techniques, respectively. The approaches to be taken include the exploration of new fluorinated Julia-Kocienski reagents, including bidirectional approaches, and those carrying resident chiral centers. A modification of the Shapiro reaction is also under development as a complementary entry into vinyl fluorides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since organofluorine compounds have seen broad applications, from pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, to NMR probes in structure-activity studies, to PET-imaging agents, this research is expected to have a wider scientific impact. The broader impacts also involve training of a diverse student population, in a research group setting at CUNY that includes undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers. Prof. Zajc will continue her outreach activities to local high schools and programs outside The City College that aim to provide students with hands on laboratory experience.</AbstractNarration>
