    <AbstractNarration>Professor Linda Shimizu of the University of South Carolina is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry to develop bis-urea macrocycles that predictably assemble into columnar structures with homogeneous channels with diameters of ~ 1 nm or less. This proposal develops new self-assembling macrocycles, explores the use of these materials to absorb reactive molecules, and investigates the effects of carrying out reactions within this confined space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental understanding of the factors that govern the reaction of molecules in small spaces could lead to new methods for organic synthesis that utilize less reactive and safer reagents. Such synthetic improvements would be environmentally friendly and economical. This research provides training for undergraduates and graduate students in organic and materials chemistry. In addition, this award supports the continuation of a chemical demonstration program that brings chemists into South Carolina K-12 classrooms to showcase the scientific method and foster interest in chemistry and the natural sciences.</AbstractNarration>
