    <AbstractNarration>In this project the PI will work with partners in the Caribbean to explore the application of information technology in disaster response, in an effort to better understand the human dimension of IT used in multiple phases of emergency preparation, management and mitigation. The focus will be on the use of wireless computing resources to support communication flow in high consequence emergency management environments, because wireless technology is proving to be the most resilient form of communication during emergency situations. The PI and her team will study emerging practices throughout the phases of the disaster management continuum, with the goal of developing human centered principles to guide the selection, application and assessment of wireless hand-held communication devices to support emergency management. The PI notes that her review of the literature has revealed no evidence or history of research on human centric evaluation of hand-held communication tools, yet the human is the most critical element in the system. In this research the PI hopes to establish basic principles relating to issues such as efficiency, safety, accuracy and ease of communication in the international emergency management community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project will advance our understanding of communication in emergency management and will provide a foundation for modeling communication for island nations in emergency management. Technology is essential, but if an appropriate and valid communication protocol is not applied the technology can be rendered useless. Thus, the study of communications models in emergency management is critical. The PI has established a partnership with the College of the Bahamas to develop a research program that provides the environment, resources and expertise to accomplish the research goals. Additionally, the team has developed a plan to transition the research into the classroom as well as into research experiences for undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
