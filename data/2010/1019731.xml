    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit: The FASEB Conference on ?Posttranscriptional control of gene expression: mechanisms of mRNA decay? will be held in Carefree, AZ on July 11-16, 2010. Messenger RNA turnover is a critical regulator of gene expression. The stability of an mRNA significantly dictates its steady-state accumulation and can be modulated by both intracellular and extracellular environmental factors to provide a rapid response mechanism to regulatory signals. Programmed stability or instability of mRNAs can enhance or repress gene expression, respectively. Moreover, multiple surveillance pathways utilize mRNA turnover to maintain mRNA quality and ensure only properly processed transcripts exit the nucleus and are utilized as substrates by the translation machinery. In addition, noncoding RNAs and RNA interference have recently attracting considerable interest from all areas of the life sciences, since they rely on selective mRNA turnover for their biological consequence on gene silencing. This meeting has developed into a unique conference that brings together the leading mRNA turnover experts in eukaryotic, archaebacteria and prokaryotic systems into one arena and provides an opportunity for researchers in the broad discipline of mRNA turnover to interact, exchange ideas and spawn new areas of future research. We anticipate this conference will provide an outstanding overview of the current and future direction of this exciting field for established investigators and trainees as they help propel the field to the next level of its development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The broader impact of the conference includes the opportunity to foster the development of junior investigators. The format of the conference is designed to promote maximal scientific interactions among all the participants and ensure students and postdoctoral associates will be able to meet and discuss their research and future plans with leaders in the mRNA turnover field. All participants have an opportunity to present posters on their research. In addition, each platform session will contain at least one oral presentation by junior scientists selected from the submitted poster abstracts to provide maximal exposure for young scientists.</AbstractNarration>
