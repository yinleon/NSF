    <AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry supports Jason Spruell of the University of California - Santa Barbara as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. Spruell will work with Prof. Craig Hawker to synthesize and study a series of block co-polymers which will self-assemble into nanoparticles of varying size, shape, internal morphology and constitution. In particular, the research will focus on developing methods which are efficient and scalable. Polymer nanoparticles will be synthesized that can be further processed, through mineralization, and further self-assembly at the mesoscale. The work will be carried out in collaboration with scientists at the Molecular Foundry at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. For his plan for broadening participation, the PI will develop hands-on science activities and other curriculum materials to be used in local-area elementary schools -- schools with significant numbers of underrepresented groups. Successful materials will be more widely disseminated to a larger audience through TeacherTube and Facebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that of Dr. Spruell is aimed at developing better methods for synthesizing nanoscopic materials. In particular, the research carried out with support from this award will enable chemists to make polymeric nanoparticles with unusual, interesting and potentially useful internal structures. Results from research like that supported here will lead to better materials with potential applications in medical diagnosis and treatment, electronic chip manufacture, and other applications. The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Spruell are aimed at encouraging young people, especially those from groups underrepresented in the sciences, to engage in interesting and exciting science activities, at the earliest stages of their educational careers.</AbstractNarration>
