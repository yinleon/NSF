    <AbstractNarration>1031194&lt;br/&gt;Nelson &lt;br/&gt;University of California-Berkeley &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IRES: U.S.-India Collaborative Research on the Impact of Conversion from Intermittent to Continuous Water Supply in Hubli-Dharwad, India &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of California-Berkeley Professor Kara Nelson will launch a 3-year International Research Experience for Students project that builds on an existing research effort between UC Berkeley and Indian researchers at the Centre for Multi-Disciplinary Development Research, a national institute supported by the Indian Council of Social Science Research. Each year, four Berkeley science and engineering graduate and undergraduate students will have the opportunity to conduct interdisciplinary research with Indian counterparts on a significant environmental problem affecting hundreds of millions of urban residents that are without access to safe water. This research focuses on the benefits of converting from intermittent to continuous piped water supply to urban households in the twin cities of Hubli and Dharwad, India. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Indian cities, piped water is supplied intermittently, leaving pipes vulnerable to contamination and forcing households to store water. Intermittent supply poses a health threat from increased levels of illnesses caused by poor water quality and limited quantity, as well as an economic burden from the costs of illness and coping. Providing water continuously has the potential to solve many of these problems; however, little information is available on the actual costs/benefits associated with conversion. The overall research goal is to fully characterize the water quality benefits of conversion from intermittent to continuous delivery of piped water in Hubli-Dharwad, which is one of the first cities in South Asia to implement such a conversion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IRES students will conduct rigorous interdisciplinary research using culture-based and molecular tools to detect microorganisms, sensors to measure physicochemical water quality characteristics, and household surveys. In the field, students will gain first-hand knowledge of the challenges of providing safe water as well as the broader context and conditions in one low-income city that is like many others around the world. The proposed research will fill critical knowledge gaps about the potential benefits of converting from intermittent to continuous water supply in piped systems, will identify the mechanism that cause contamination in these systems, including the role that household behaviors play in water contamination, and will develop low-cost, innovative methods to monitor water quality using sensor networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will give motivated students the opportunity to engage in meaningful research for the direct benefit of society. They will develop networks with peers and mentors from the foreign counterpart institutions, and with local populations that will benefit directly from this research. The IRES opportunity will improve students abilities and knowledge in science and engineering while teaching the skills and understanding to enable them to both collaborate and compete in an increasingly globalized world.</AbstractNarration>
