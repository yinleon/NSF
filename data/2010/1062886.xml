    <AbstractNarration>This three-year REU Site program at Michigan Technological University will provide the opportunity for diverse cohorts of ten highly talented undergraduate students per year to participate in interdisciplinary research related to the effective use of renewable fuels in transportation. The overall goal of the program is to excite and equip students for further success in undergraduate and graduate programs that provide tomorrow's scientists and engineers with higher level skills, resources, and room for imagination to substantially transform our energy and transportation systems. The program's objectives are to increase students' interest in conducting research, basic understanding of interdisciplinary concepts through hands-on-learning, STEM problem-solving skills and ability to apply these skills to research problems, capacity for self efficacy as an independent research, ability to effectively collaborate as part of a highly diverse team, and communication competencies at both the interpersonal and presentational level. In addition, the program will provide REU students opportunities to attend professional meetings, seminars, conferences, and in-depth information related to applying to graduate school and obtaining funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the REU Site program are related to the development of a larger and more diverse future workforce in the area of renewable transportation fuels a research area that holds great promise in its potential to help lower greenhouse gas emissions and the reliance on foreign energy sources. REU students will play an active role in the proposed research projects under the supervision of participating faculty mentors and graduate research assistants. The research experience gained from these projects will help REU students to become familiar with the process of conducting scientific research, and using practical approaches to solve complex problems. The existing research facilities and resources provide an excellent environment for these students to participate in research that is already yielding promising results.</AbstractNarration>
