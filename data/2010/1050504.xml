    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for a symposium, from the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM), that will bring together leading experts in cell biology, physiology, biophysics, applied mathematics, continuum mechanics, computational mechanics, bioengineering, and regenerative medicine to stimulate critical discussions and identify future challenges and opportunities in computational biomechanics. It has the potential to advance the field in the following directions: (i) mathematical modeling and computational simulation on the molecular, cellular, tissue, and organ levels; (ii) characterization of the relevant biological, chemical, electrical, and mechanical fields; (iii) image-based, patient-specific design of computational models; (iv) verification and validation of computational models on the molecular, cellular, tissue, and organ levels. The symposium will be held between August 29 and September 02, 2011 at Stanford University, California. It will feature five keynote speakers, approximately 40 invited speakers, and approximately 60 to 80 participants. This proposal will support undergraduates and young researchers to actively participate in the symposium through podium and poster presentations. Moreover, it will allow dissemination of their research activities in the hardcopy book of conference proceedings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This IUTAM symposium will have direct academic, scientific, and educational impact. Academically, it will establish and broaden the computational biomechanics community, create synergies, and reach out to scientists who have not traditionally been part of this community. Scientifically, it will identify new research directions and push frontiers in computational biomechanics with results made available to the broad public in the form of a hardcopy book of conference proceedings and a multiple-author expert review paper on challenges and advances in computer models in biomechanics. Educationally, it will encourage the participation of undergraduates and young researchers from underrepresented groups and institutions that are traditionally short of funding which will be crucial to strengthen the computational biomechanics community now and in the future.</AbstractNarration>
