    <AbstractNarration>This research establishes MIST, the MIddleware Security and Testing facility,&lt;br/&gt;to identify security vulnerabilities in middleware, which include e-commerce&lt;br/&gt;systems, supercomputers, and scientific and commercial networks. The&lt;br/&gt;researchers are identifying limitations in current abilities to identify and&lt;br/&gt;remediate vulnerabilities in the middleware. The limitations include assessment&lt;br/&gt;techniques that provide insufficient focus on critical vulnerabilities and are&lt;br/&gt;subject to high false-positives, tools that provide limited abilities to &lt;br/&gt;find serious vulnerabilities, little or no formal characterization of&lt;br/&gt;vulnerabilities, lack of trained security analysts to perform vulnerability&lt;br/&gt;assessment, scarcity of curricula, both in academia and professional training,&lt;br/&gt;for training security analysts, scarcity of training in software engineering&lt;br/&gt;and design techniques for secure systems, and lack of independent vulnerability&lt;br/&gt;assessment activities in middleware software development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers are developing first principles based vulnerability assessment&lt;br/&gt;(FPVA) that starts with architectural and resource analysis of the software,&lt;br/&gt;identifying high-value assets, and then derives threats based on how the&lt;br/&gt;assets are used. This research includes new and extended algorithms and&lt;br/&gt;techniques for tools to help improve the automation of this task, and new&lt;br/&gt;software engineering and coding techniques for developing secure systems.&lt;br/&gt;Results from their FPVA assessment activities are used to develop formal&lt;br/&gt;characterizations of these hard-to-discover vulnerabilities and, from these&lt;br/&gt;characterizations, develop algorithms for detecting these vulnerabilities.&lt;br/&gt;From algorithms, they are developing new automated tools for detection. The&lt;br/&gt;tools take the form of plug-ins to existing tools (to reduce unnecessary&lt;br/&gt;effort and time-to-deployment). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project expands the skills software developers by developing training&lt;br/&gt;materials in the form of tutorials, short courses, and a new undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;course in vulnerability assessment and secure coding practices.</AbstractNarration>
