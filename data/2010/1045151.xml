    <AbstractNarration>The main goal of this research is to further develop, apply, and analyze a &lt;br/&gt;computational tool that can be used to examine the transport tendencies along &lt;br/&gt;the U.S. East Coast including Florida, Georgia, and both Carolinas as they &lt;br/&gt;relate to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The central piece of this &lt;br/&gt;computational tool will be the Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) hydrodynamic &lt;br/&gt;model. ADCIRC is a finite element model for solving time?dependent, free &lt;br/&gt;surface circulation and transport problems in two? and three?dimensions. &lt;br/&gt;Existing finite element meshes of the region will be further developed to &lt;br/&gt;provide an unprecedented level of resolution and physical detail, including &lt;br/&gt;detailed coverage of coastal rivers and lagoons, tidal creeks, the Atlantic &lt;br/&gt;Intracoastal Waterway, and tidally flooded marshes. The ability to accurately &lt;br/&gt;simulate the tidal dynamics of this region, as well as hurricane storm surge, &lt;br/&gt;will be coupled with recent and ongoing development of the transport &lt;br/&gt;capabilities of the ADCIRC model using discontinuous Galerkin methods. The &lt;br/&gt;integration and further development of these three key components, i.e., the &lt;br/&gt;high-resolution finite element meshes, the ability to accurately simulate &lt;br/&gt;tidal and storm surge dynamics, and robust, mass-conserving transport &lt;br/&gt;algorithms, will provide a powerful computational tool that will be used to &lt;br/&gt;simulate the transport tendencies of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill along the &lt;br/&gt;U.S. East Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deepwater Horizon oil spill began on April 20, 2010 as a result of an oil &lt;br/&gt;well blowout that caused an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon offshore &lt;br/&gt;drilling platform located forty miles southeast off the Louisiana coast. A &lt;br/&gt;major and immediate concern related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill is the &lt;br/&gt;possibility of the oil slick reaching the Loop Current ? a warm ocean current &lt;br/&gt;that enters the Gulf of Mexico flowing northward through the Yucatan Strait &lt;br/&gt;and that exits flowing east through the Florida Straits continuing northward &lt;br/&gt;along the east coast of Florida as the Gulf Stream. Oil entering the Loop &lt;br/&gt;Current would eventually be transported far afield to the Atlantic Ocean where &lt;br/&gt;the presence of large-scale eddies that separate from the western edge of the &lt;br/&gt;Gulf Stream have the potential to carry oil toward the U.S. East Coast. There &lt;br/&gt;is additional concern regarding the transport of oil that may occur during the &lt;br/&gt;upcoming Atlantic Hurricane Season, which has been forecasted by NOAA to be an &lt;br/&gt;?active to extremely active? hurricane season. The transport of oil towards &lt;br/&gt;the U.S. East Coast ? by means of reaching the Loop Current or from the onset &lt;br/&gt;of a hurricane ? would obviously have a major detrimental impact on the &lt;br/&gt;coastal environment, severely damaging their beaches and coastal wetlands, &lt;br/&gt;which serve as critical habitats to the fish and wildlife. The primary &lt;br/&gt;objective of this proposal is to provide a computational tool that will be &lt;br/&gt;used to help analyze and assess possible damage from the Deepwater Horizon oil &lt;br/&gt;spill along the U.S. East Coast including Florida, Georgia, and both Carolinas.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the fate and transport of oil spill remnants (e.g., tar&lt;br/&gt;balls) entrained in Gulf Stream eddies and feeding the U.S. East Coast will be &lt;br/&gt;modeled along the shelf and into the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and &lt;br/&gt;estuarine systems. Using available data sources, simulations will be performed &lt;br/&gt;to ultimately identify areas especially susceptible to receiving transported &lt;br/&gt;oil and likely areas of deposition. The model and results will also be &lt;br/&gt;transferable to other regions of the Gulf of Mexico.</AbstractNarration>
