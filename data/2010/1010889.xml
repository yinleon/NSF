    <AbstractNarration>The Initiative in Innovative Computing in the Harvard University School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, in collaboration with the Encyclopedia of Life Learning and Education Group, University of Nebraska State Museum, Northwestern University Department of Learning Sciences, the Center for Human Growth and Development at the University of Michigan, the California Academy of Sciences, the Field Museum of Natural History, the Boston Children's Museum, the Harvard Museum of Natural History, and TERC, will develop, evaluate and disseminate Life on Earth, a developmentally-appropriate intervention for learning about the Tree of Life, Common Descent, and Natural Selection in museum settings. The primary goals of the project are to improve museum visitor understanding of evolution and to use innovative touch-screen technology to enhance museum visitor learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deliverables are eight developmentally flexible Life on Earth activities, designed to allow visitors to choose their own difficulty level. Each activity is designed to engage visitors in learning one of the two key concepts of evolution: common descent and natural selection. The activities are unified within a conceptual framework based on a research-based, peer-reviewed developmental learning progression for an understanding of evolution. Specific target audiences are: Beginner (3rd-5th grade), Intermediate (6th-8th grade, and Advanced (9th-Adult). These activities, developed as computer software, will be delivered via a compelling multi-touch, multi-user digital interface with the potential to transform the way science is experienced in informal settings. The highly qualified and experienced core team is supported by a strong advisory group of evolutionary biologists, science educators, and informal learning professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities will be developed in diverse museum settings with input from their different audiences: natural history museum, science museum, children's museum. The direct potential public impact is estimated at approximately 4.5 million for the partner museums; potential indirect impacts are across the ISE field through a free software package downloadable to any institution with the appropriate hardware. The potential professional audience is exhibit developers seeking to develop learning experiences about evolution in natural history museums, science museums, zoos, aquaria, and other ISE institutions. Front-end evaluation, formative evaluation and prototyping will be conducted by the project team lead by Dr. Judy Diamond and Dr. Ann Spiegel. Summative evaluation will be conducted by TERC.</AbstractNarration>
