    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program supports Professor Anna Gudmundsdottir of the University of Cincinnati who will develop a fundamental understanding of the reactivity of simple triplet 1,2 diradicals and how they can be used to initiate photorelease from hydroxyphenyl-crotoane ester derivatives. Not knowing the mechanism and the rate of the release from these hydroxyphenylcrotoane ester derivatives prevents their use as photoremovable photoprotecting groups (PRPGs). The long-term goal is to design PRPGs to study molecular motors. The objective of this work is to determine the mechanism for triplet photoisomerization of simple alkenes and vinyl azides and explore if triplet 1,2-biradical can be formed selectivity and if they can be used to both release alcohols from PRPGs and to form triplet vinyl nitrenes. The proposed research will result in a better understanding of the reactivity of triplet 1,2-biradicals and vinyl nitrenes. Furthermore, the proposed research will lead to new PRPGs and the elucidation of the mechanism for release from these PRPGs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Professor Anna Gudmundsdottir performs research that will potentially impact physiology studies since these PRPGs can be used to study physiological events in living systems. Furthermore, understanding the mechanism for photorelease from the proposed PRPGs will make it possible to design a new generation of PRPGs that can be used in various applications, such as delivering drugs, and releasing fragrances and bug repellent in household products. The PI proposes to implement a program by attracting both high school and undergraduate students, with a focus on attracting underrepresented students to do research in various research groups within the Chemistry Department, including the PI's, and also to provide these students with educational activities that focus on their professional development. Thus, the proposed research and the developmental teaching will lead to enhanced infrastructure within the PI's department and serve as an outreach program, for example, at the Central State University Chemistry Department and other schools in the region. Advancement of these students is expected to have a broad societal impact, complemented by the positive effect that the research outcomes are expected to have.</AbstractNarration>
