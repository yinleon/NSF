    <AbstractNarration>Buhler&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1009213&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator undertakes a theoretical and numerical&lt;br/&gt;study of nonlinear interactions between waves and vortices in&lt;br/&gt;problems spanning several subject areas, namely atmosphere and&lt;br/&gt;ocean fluid dynamics, small-scale engineering applied to particle&lt;br/&gt;mixing, and the dynamics of rotating superfluids in quantum&lt;br/&gt;mechanics. Project topics include energy exchanges between&lt;br/&gt;random waves and vortices in the ocean, the role of wave-induced&lt;br/&gt;vortex structures for particle dispersal in the deep ocean, the&lt;br/&gt;design and dynamics of small-scale engineering devices to model&lt;br/&gt;the acoustic mixing of immersed particles, and the peculiar fluid&lt;br/&gt;dynamics that attends the quantum-mechanical interactions between&lt;br/&gt;waves and point vortices in rotating superfluids. A common theme&lt;br/&gt;of these problems is that they involve huge separations of scale&lt;br/&gt;between different dynamical components of the flows. Such&lt;br/&gt;separations present mathematical difficulties and make&lt;br/&gt;straightforward numerical simulations impractical. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator takes up several problems that involve&lt;br/&gt;analysis of the interactions between waves and vortices in fluid&lt;br/&gt;flows: ocean fluid dynamics relevant to climate dynamics,&lt;br/&gt;small-scale fluid engineering applied to acoustic mixing, and&lt;br/&gt;rotating superfluids in condensed matter physics. The ocean is a&lt;br/&gt;vast environment in which a multitude of dynamical components&lt;br/&gt;such as waves and currents interact, and these interactions&lt;br/&gt;eventually determine the present ocean state and also its future&lt;br/&gt;development. Our ability to predict ocean dynamics hinges&lt;br/&gt;delicately on our ability to understand and to model these&lt;br/&gt;interactions, because a direct computer simulation far exceeds&lt;br/&gt;our computational resources and will do so for decades to come. &lt;br/&gt;This is so because different dynamical components of the flows&lt;br/&gt;occur at vastly different scales of length or time. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator mathematically and computationally studies the&lt;br/&gt;interactions between waves and vortices, using modern&lt;br/&gt;mathematical theory to simplify and thereby to reduce the&lt;br/&gt;complexity of the interactions that must be modelled on a&lt;br/&gt;computer. Similar scale-separated interactions among dynamical&lt;br/&gt;components of flows are studied in other complex systems of&lt;br/&gt;technological relevance, such as non-invasive particle mixing&lt;br/&gt;techniques using wave engineering, and the detailed study of&lt;br/&gt;superfluid behaviour that has recently become possible using&lt;br/&gt;breakthroughs in laboratory technology.</AbstractNarration>
