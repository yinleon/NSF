    <AbstractNarration>Functionalized end effectors are built from nanosystems to support intelligent nanorobotic manipulation. This is achieved using segment-nanostructure-based nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) and nonophotonic systems. Internal electron tunneling and optical coupling are used as the common base of these end effectors for achieving high resolution while keeping to nano scale. Specific problems investigated include (1) the internal electron tunneling and optical coupling between the segmented elements in a nanostructure such as carbon nanotube shells, peapod nanowires, head-to-head positioned nanotube tips and dimmer nanospheres, (2) the development of sub-nanometer position/displacement sensors, picoNewton force sensors, and attogram mass detectors using the segmented nanostructures, (3) integrating these sensors onto transmission electron microscope compatible chips, atomic force catilevers, and rolled up helical nanobelts, and (4) the application of these systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project impacts the development of new nanotechnology for nanorobotics including theory and processes for actual construction of systems. This leads to new tools for manufacturing and other technology fields such as the electronics and microscopy industries. Optical nanoantennas have the potential to remarkably enhance energy adsorption for solar cells. Applications are found in single molecule manipulation in biology, material characterization and inter-molecule interactions in supramolecular chemistry. General applications include the potential application of intelligent nanosystems in health care. Broad outreach is achieved through lectures, workshops, courses and websites for K-12 students and teachers, as well as for the public who have an interest in this emerging field.</AbstractNarration>
