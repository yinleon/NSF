    <AbstractNarration>1033906&lt;br/&gt;Boppart&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite important advances within the past decade, current tissue engineered skin equivalents represent little more than a fragile, short-term dressing for patients that need viable skin replacements. The major weakness in current skin equivalents is that the constituent cells are cultured and applied under conditions that are very different from that of natural skin. It is believed that this is principally due to our limited understanding of the roles that 3-D scaffold topography and mechanical stimuli have on the intercellular organization, connectivity, and communication of engineered tissues. In this project an advanced integrated microscope capable of simultaneous optical coherence and multi-photon microscopy, and optical coherence elastography is utilized to uniquely visualize the structural and functional relationships of cells within 3-D engineered skin constructs, and measure the evolving biomechanical properties. Second, this project investigates and longitudinally images in 3-D the growth of engineered skin constructs on varying microtopographic substrates. This will provide fundamental insight into the mechanical influences at the dermal-epidermal junction on the keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Third, the effects of mechanical stimuli on these constructs will be investigated, defining how varying stimuli affect the 3-D cell dynamics and tissue organization over time. such stimulation effects will provide a more physiologically-relevant culture condition. Finally, this project will longitudinally image the cell and tissue responses in vivo following the grafting of the skin constructs to host pre-clinical models, contributing significantly to our understanding of how engineered tissue grafts interface with biological hosts.</AbstractNarration>
