    <AbstractNarration>Walking, swimming, flying, burrowing and chewing are rhythmic behaviors that allow animals to survive and reproduce. These behaviors remain effective even in the presence of unexpected perturbations or noise. The investigators hypothesize that the robustness of a pattern generator is primarily mediated by the interplay of neural dynamics and sensory input. This hypothesis will be tested by (1) studying in vivo responses of a feeding pattern generator to mechanical perturbations in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica, whose identified neurons and well-studied biomechanics make it especially experimentally tractable, (2) using theoretical, computational and mathematical tools to develop insight into dynamical architectures of robustness, such as a globally stable limit cycles, or stable heteroclinic channels and (3) directly testing the central hypothesis using a semi-intact preparation that can generate behavior, and can respond to mechanical perturbations, to determine the role of identified sensory neurons in generating appropriate responses to these perturbations by selectively activating or inhibiting the neurons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing an understanding of robust dynamical architectures would have many applications. In particular, the research will open up the possibility of creating control architectures for robots that can flexibly cope with unpredictable environmental changes, and successfully pursue long-term goals despite environmental perturbations. It will play an important role in developing robust prosthetic devices that cope flexibly with everyday tasks, simplifying the process of rehabilitation. Additionally, this project enhances the efforts of the lead investigator, a neurobiologist, and the co-investigator, a mathematician, to co-mentor students in the interdisciplinary area of mathematical and computational neuroscience, and also impacts the content of the interdisciplinary courses that they teach.</AbstractNarration>
