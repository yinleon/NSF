    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of a group of US-based researchers and graduate students at a training school on ``Braids in Algebra, Geometry and Topology'', to be held January 17-28, 2011 in Hanoi. Lorenz is one of the organizers of the workshop while Le is one of the principal lecturers. The training school is primarily aimed at graduate students and young researchers. A series of six mini-courses by some of the world's leading experts will cover topics ranging from an introduction to the theory of braid groups to some current research in knot theory, quantum groups, and hyperplane arrangements, three thriving branches of mathematics where braid groups play an essential role. Immediately following the training school, there will be a 3-day workshop for specialists that will be devoted to a discussion of recent advances and &lt;br/&gt;perspectives for future developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Braids, originally introduced in the context of low-dimensional topology, have since developed into a theme that permeates large parts of mathematics and mathematical physics, thereby providing a link between many different areas of current research. The Institute of Mathematics at the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology in Hanoi is the center of mathematical research in Vietnam; it has a strong tradition of research in several areas of algebra, geometry, and topology that are closely tied to braid groups. The training school in Hanoi will introduce participating students to some important new developments in a broad range of mathematical subjects, focusing on the unifying role of braid group. In adopting this approach, the organizers aim to present a panoramic view of current research in mathematics and counteract a trend towards specialization and exclusive focus on one narrow topic. In addition, the organizers expect that the school and its accompanying workshop will boost interdisciplinary research as well as help promoting exchanges and &lt;br/&gt;collaborations between mathematicians in the region of Southeast Asia and &lt;br/&gt;experts from Europe and the United States.</AbstractNarration>
