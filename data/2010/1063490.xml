    <AbstractNarration>This project will support the establishment of a new international research collaboration between the University of Texas-Dallas (UTD) and the New University of Lisbon (UNL) in Portugal. Researchers at UNL focus on materials research, and recently demonstrated the use of cellulose based paper as either a substrate for physical support of electronic devices (such as organic thin film transistors, logic circuits and electrochromic displays) or as an ?interstrate? structure where the device is built on both sides of the cellulose sheet. The group at UT Dallas focuses on device design and process integration, and recently demonstrated Flexible CMOS digital gates and integrated column drivers for electrophoretic displays, non-volatile memory based on the organic ferroelectric polymer P(VDF-TrFE), and flexible displays based on organic thin-film transistors and organic light emitting diodes. In the current catalytic project, the two teams will work together to develop new devices based on integrating novel device structures and circuits on cellulose substrates, providing the possibility for very inexpensive, highly functional electronic paper. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the planning visit supported through this award are substantial. The development of a new field of electronics based upon cellulose is potentially transformative, and the complementary research expertise and infrastructure will foster strong international collaborations. Student researchers will participate in the planning visit to Portugal and gain valuable international experience and networks. Anticipated follow-on activities also include the development of long-term exchange programs for both US and Portuguese students.</AbstractNarration>
