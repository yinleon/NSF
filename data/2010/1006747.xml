    <AbstractNarration>Technical: This project addresses fundamental electronic/photonic materials science synthesis/processing research to achieve condensed phase (CP) atomic layer deposition (ALD) for formation of semiconductor grade (purity, crystallinity) conformal nanoscale films with atomic level control. The key feature of ALD is that limited reactions are used to control the deposition rate, not the time or flux; those reactions are used in a cycle, where an atomic layer or monolayer (ML) is deposited each cycle. Growth is then a function of the cycle chemistry and the number of cycles used. The reactions are controlled by a limiting reagent, generally the deposit surface area. While the vast majority of ALD is performed using gas or vacuum phase processes, this project takes an electrochemistry condensed phase (CP) approach to atomic level control of electronic materials synthesis/processing. The main thrust is exploration of CP-ALD chemistry formation of high quality junctions needed for device fabrication, e.g., the formation of multijunction photovoltaics (PV). Conformal deposition of nanoscale films of semiconductors, metals and insulators on insulators, metals and semiconductors are included. The work aims to increase the diversity of materials which can be formed using CP-ALD. Deposition of compounds and metals on conducting surfaces has been successful. Ideas concerning the deposition of nanofilms on insulators, and of oxides or insulators will be studied. In addition, continued work concerning deposition of metals, elemental semiconductors, and compounds on each other will be extended. Systems proposed for study are from the areas of microelectronics, memory and photovoltaics. &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance in electronics and photonics. The primary impact of this project will be study and development of CP-ALD, in order to provide alternative methodologies to the gas and vacuum based electronic materials synthesis and processing techniques. Dissemination of research results will be by creation of a Wiki, or specialized web page, dedicated to CP-ALD methods, results, equipment, and the ancillary knowledge required to form such deposits. The PI actively addresses increasing diversity within science and engineering. The project is interdisciplinary, providing graduate and undergraduate students with advantageous opportunities to do research that bridges basic research and application, and research across traditional fields of materials science, chemistry, and engineering. In addition to experiencing, and contributing to an important topic centered in unique materials research, they will learn basic skills required in the use of electronic materials characterization tools.</AbstractNarration>
