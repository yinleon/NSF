    <AbstractNarration>Ultrabroadband high-power laser technology has opened a door to extreme optical sciences, such as frequency-comb metrology, attosecond science, and relativistic optics. Optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification (OPCPA) has become one of the key techniques of these emerging research areas employing the broad amplification bandwidth and wavelength tunability of optical parametric amplification (OPA). This proposal aims to develop a novel cavity-based parametric amplification technique that will allow octave-spanning gain bandwidth and near-quantum-limited conversion efficiency at ~100 MHz repetition rates, using ordinary pump sources and OPA media. This technique, referred to as cavity-enhanced optical parametric chirped-pulse amplification (C-OPCPA), recycles and passively reshapes pump pulses inside an external cavity to efficiently amplify seed pulses in a nonlinear medium. C-OPCPA employs the use of enhanced pump intensity to compensate for wave-vector mismatch, which, in the C-OPCPA geometry, can lead to efficient amplification at bandwidths of more than one octave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will make significant contributions to the fundamental understanding of cavity dynamics with gain and nonlinear loss and develop a new method in order to achieve, for the first time, a highly efficient octave-spanning parametric amplifier at ~100 MHz repetition rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;C-OPCPA systems are very useful for many scientific and technological applications, such as frequency-comb amplification and attosecond metrology. The C-OPCPA system to be demonstrated can be scaled up to much higher average power and serve as a pump source for high-flux attosecond XUV pulse generation via high-harmonic generation. The project will also provide a teaching vehicle for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and visiting scientists.</AbstractNarration>
