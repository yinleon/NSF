    <AbstractNarration>Many computing services are moving to the "cloud" because cloud&lt;br/&gt;computing offers economic and operational benefits. However, cloud&lt;br/&gt;services not only are complex black boxes operated by third parties but&lt;br/&gt;also refuse to give service guarantees. Thus, instead of trying to make&lt;br/&gt;cloud services more trustworthy (that is, giving customers reasons to&lt;br/&gt;place faith in the cloud), this project explicitly removes trust from&lt;br/&gt;the cloud: the project is building systems that give cloud customers&lt;br/&gt;guarantees, even under arbitrary service malfunctions. Two such systems&lt;br/&gt;concern storage and function computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the storage system, the challenge is to use client-side&lt;br/&gt;verification to resist arbitrary or malicious cloud malfunctions (losing&lt;br/&gt;data, returning stale data, corrupting data, compromising data, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;Under the function computation system, a client specifies a computation&lt;br/&gt;to a server, the server executes it and returns the output and auxiliary&lt;br/&gt;information, and the client uses the auxiliary information to&lt;br/&gt;efficiently check whether the output is correct. The approach is to&lt;br/&gt;adapt, and translate into practice, a fascinating body of theory (on&lt;br/&gt;probabilistically checkable and interactive proofs) that is currently&lt;br/&gt;thought to be impractical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With qualitative advances in reliable yet practical computing, this&lt;br/&gt;project will make cloud computing safer for existing customers and spur&lt;br/&gt;the adoption of cloud services. This will mean more people paying less&lt;br/&gt;for computing, producing beneficial effects throughout the computational&lt;br/&gt;ecosystem. The educational thrusts include teaching graduate students to&lt;br/&gt;teach (applying the K-12 student teaching model), graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate mentoring, curriculum development, and outreach to&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
