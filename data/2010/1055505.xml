    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Peter T. Wolczanski of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University will explore the utilization of first row transition metals in new carbon-carbon bond forming reactions, selective dinitrogen binding reactions, the oxidative functionalization of hydrocarbons, and metal clusters as potential water reduction catalysts. Radical reactions are one means to oxidize hydrocarbons, but the lack of selectivity in these transformations limits their utility. The research proposed suggests a way of controlling radical processes that will permit selective oxidations to be performed. Furthermore, dihydrogen (H2) that is not produced from hydrocarbons (its predominant source) is a promising alternative fuel, and this research explores different approaches to water reduction as a means to produce H2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, the proposed work could lead to new C-C bond forming processes that can be applied to the synthesis of commodity or fine (e.g., drugs) chemicals. Hydrocarbon oxidation and water splitting are critical synthesis and energy problems of the 21st century. The direct transformation of hydrocarbons to value-added products has the potential for enormous energy and cost savings. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in various spectroscopies, X-ray crystallography, kinetics and mechanistic evaluations, molecular orbital calculations as well as in handling air sensitive compounds. Dissemination of this research through presentations at meetings, and via the promotion of science at the 5th-grade level and to 8th grade girls, is included. The production of independent, versatile PhDs capable of adapting to a challenging and fluctuating postdoctoral, academic or industrial market is a concurrent human resource objective.</AbstractNarration>
