    <AbstractNarration>This project is re-designing biochemistry laboratory courses, from the traditional structured experiments based on laboratory manuals to a more exploratory, project-based approach. To that end, this project is (i) designing a year-long, research-based biochemistry laboratory course for immediate implementation, (ii) developing the course as a series of individual units, or modules, which can be easily transferred to other institutions, and (iii) developing and publishing a website that disseminates the infrastructure to others interested in improving their undergraduate biochemistry programs. The long-term educational goal is to enhance the scientific education of undergraduate students, and to provide other biochemistry educators with a framework by which they can transform their own programs, thereby having a broader impact on the quality of education of biochemistry students. The goal is to educate scientists, not science majors.&lt;br/&gt;The educational materials and resources developed are available to other educators and institutions via a website. The work is also being disseminated via publication in appropriate educational journals, and via presentations at regional and national meetings which biochemistry educators attend.</AbstractNarration>
