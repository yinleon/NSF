    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;1029119&lt;br/&gt;Walker, Robert T., Michigan State University US-Brazil Planning Visit: The Transamazon at 40 - A Generation Comes of Age&lt;br/&gt;This planning visit to the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) is expected to result in a proposal for a workshop to assess the fiscal and environmental costs and benefits of constructing the Transamazon Highway. An award will allow Drs. Robert T. Walker and Cynthia S. Simmons, Michigan State University (MSU), to meet with Dr. Scott Hoefle, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). The workshop will assemble experts on the Transamazon Highway and its surroundings to consider the current state of knowledge of the social and environmental impacts of the highway. The planning visit considers among other things workshop logistics and themes, which include construction costs, maintenance costs, impacts on indigenous peoples, environmental impacts, the emergent agricultural economy, and mineral production.&lt;br/&gt;The planning visit builds on recent and preliminary collaborations among participants. The workshop is meant to be the first formal phase of a three-year collaboration between US and Brazilian researchers. The Brazilian team consists of Geography faculty at UFRJ, who have also extended invitations to select researchers in France. Workshop organizers plan to invite people across the spectrum of academic experience, from established professors to assistant professors to graduate students recruited from both MSU and UFRJ with expertise in both social and environmental sciences. Young researchers will be expected to present and develop a manuscript for circulation within the group and for ultimate publication. The workshop will expand communication about current understanding of the Transamazon Highway and will provide an opportunity to develop new collaborations between environmental and social scientists, between US and Brazilian citizens, and between young and experienced researchers.</AbstractNarration>
