    <AbstractNarration>This award is made in support of a collaborative project called "Frontiers in Activity Recognition" whereby a group of experts from different fields of computer science, engineering, mathematics and statistics convene in a workshop to be held in the vicinity of UCLA. &lt;br/&gt;One component of the workshop consists in interactive break-out sessions where different approaches to activity representation (descriptors) and recognition will be analyzed. A second component consists in a competition, announced to the broad public ahead of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), whereby an extensive dataset provided by a third party will be released, with benchmarks, and contestants will be invited to submit their best results in the detection of a number of action categories. The proposers of high-ranking approaches will be invited to the workshop to present their results and discuss it in the context of the analysis of the state of the art to be performed as part of the field assessment. The workshop can have broad impact to many applications ranging from security (surveillance, monitoring) to environmental science (habitat monitoring, global warming), to industrial operations (factory floor optimization), to multi-media and information retrieval (content-based video meta-data extraction), to entertainment (input devices for games), and to transportation (driver assistance).</AbstractNarration>
