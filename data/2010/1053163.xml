    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for a five-day International Conference on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) Modeling Fluids and Complex Fluids to be held at the Centre for Nonlinear Studies, Northwest University, Xi'an, P.R. China, June 13-17, 2011. The award will provide partial support for US participants, with a special emphasis on graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty, and researchers from under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some important progress has been recently made in analysis and understanding of Partial Differential Equation that describe many important fluid phenomena related to oceanic and atmospheric dynamics, motion of liquid crystals and other applications. In addition, significant progress has been made in the analytical and numerical study of non-Newtonian complex fluids and polymeric flows, and in the study of transport and mixing in fluid turbulence. This international conference is aimed at presenting and developing the recent successful approaches and at fostering collaborations between researchers from different disciplines including PDEs, harmonic analysis and numerical computations. It is expected that this conference will yield new strategies for the resolution of many remaining open problems. Plenary talks by leading experts in the field will be combined with shorter talks, discussions and poster presentations. All junior participants will be encouraged and given an opportunity to present their results. The National Natural Science Foundation (NNSF) of the P.R. China and the Centre for Nonlinear Studies at Northwest University will provide funds to cover the local expenses in China. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://www.math.okstate.edu/~jiahong/PDE_Conference/Xian_Conference</AbstractNarration>
