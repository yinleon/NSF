    <AbstractNarration>This project aims to systematically investigate the analysis, design, and management of environmentally powered micro-scale systems. The project will comprise of three research thrusts, namely: (a) Techniques for efficient power extraction from micro-scale energy transducers. Specific research artifacts include new power converter designs and maximum power point tracking schemes that are specifically optimized for use with micro-scale energy transducers, (b) Techniques for efficient storage and consumption of harvested power. As part of this thrust, new ways of synergistically combining heterogeneous energy buffer elements (e.g., thin film batteries and ultra-capacitors) to minimize losses during energy storage will be explored. New harvesting-aware power management techniques will also be developed to help realize the goal of self-sustained operation (i.e., net-zero energy operation), and (c) Simulation models of various system components (e.g., energy transducers, power converters) will be developed to enable systematic design space exploration of micro-scale energy harvesting systems. These models will be used to build simulation tools that allow designers to evaluate the impact of various design choices and understand the numerous design trade-offs while architecting highly efficient micro-scale energy harvesting systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impact, the techniques developed as part of this project have the potential to greatly reduce the need for battery replacement in emerging application domains such as biomedical implants and networks of smart dust sensors. This will not only remove one of the biggest showstoppers to their large-scale adoption, but also decrease the large number of batteries that are discarded every year and cause significant heavy metal contamination in landfills and ground water sources. From an educational perspective, the research results developed as part of this project will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses at Purdue, specifically, Embedded Systems (ECE 568), System-on-Chip Design (ECE 695R), and Advanced VLSI Design (ECE 695KR). Beyond the classroom, the systems developed as part of this project will directly impact the broader community through unique programs at Purdue such as the Engineering Projects In Community Service, which supports teams of faculty and students that work together on practical projects of relevance to the local community.</AbstractNarration>
