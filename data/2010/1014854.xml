    <AbstractNarration>This workshop entitled "New Research on Gender in Political Psychology" brings together an international group of junior and senior scholars studying gender and political psychology in order to share their recent research, develop mentoring relationships, and facilitate publications of papers in high quality outlets. In addition, the conference will enable the discussion of teaching techniques in this area and will facilitate researchers to communicate their work to practioners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of gender in political science addresses the problems of women's political underrepresentation. Many unanswered questions related to this can be addressed fruitfully by the application of psychological theoreis and concepts. This workshop will provide a forum for state-of-the-art research on gender and political psychology to be shared with and reviewed by leading scholars in the field. The small nature of the conference helps to ensure that it will provide opportunities for junior and senior scholars to read and react meaningfully to each other's work, to develop productive and supportive mentority relationships, to discuss possible collaborations, and to facilitate publication of the conference papers in high quality outlets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will also assist junior scholars, primarily female junior scholars, in producing and publishing high quality research in order to achieve professional success, both at their institutions and in the discipline. The workshop gooals address specific problems cited in the 2005 American Political Science Association's "Women's Advancement in Political Science Report" including improvidng mentoring of junior female scholars and increasing the visibility of gender research in top journals. Overall, this concference is one step in helping to rectify the problem of a "leaky pipeline" for women and to assist scholarship on women and politics in gaining acceptance in the top journals.</AbstractNarration>
