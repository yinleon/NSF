    <AbstractNarration>The Association for Institutional Research will organize and conduct two three-day workshops, scheduled approximately one year apart, to review the existing international knowledge base and exemplary policies and programs designed to enhance the status and participation of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and careers. In brief, the primary goals of the workshops are to: (1) systematically review relevant international research literatures to enhance understanding of the barriers and challenges to the full participation of all women in STEM disciplines and careers; and (2) identify reliable and credible data sources and data gaps in order to create a research agenda. Using international comparative data, the effects of the intersections of gender and race/ethnicity, commonalities and differences among women in STEM, and strategies, policies, and programs that are effective in enhancing women?s participation in STEM will be identified. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project?s intellectual merit lies in its inclusive systematic approach using intensive and extensive reviews and analyses of the relevant international comparative research and evaluation literatures to catalyze interdisciplinary discussion, and serve as a basis for defining a strategic research agenda. A major component of the workshop will be a guided discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of extant research on policies, practices, and programs at the national, regional, and international levels that enhance women?s full participation in STEM careers. The workshop will identify critical gaps in the data and research literatures on women in STEM fields, and identify comparative data on international cultural and structural differences and commonalities to pinpoint issues and topics for further research on women in STEM fields that transcend national, political, and cultural boundaries. The ultimate goal is to design, implement, and evaluate effective programs and practices to broaden the participation of all women in STEM fields in the U.S. and abroad. Additional contributions include identifying collaborators and creating networks for future international collaborations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project?s broader impact will be realized through the establishment of a repository for multi-national research and an agenda that will eventually result in a rich and competitive technical workforce that is strengthened by the broader participation of all women. The workshop will propose strategies to attract and retain more women across ability, race, and ethnic groups not only into the STEM workforce, but also into STEM leadership positions, thus contributing to achieving the broader goal of strengthening scientific, technical and economic capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop outcomes are expected to include a report that: summarizes reviews of relevant literatures; identifies gaps in research, data collection, and evaluation; and outlines recommendations for establishing strategic research agendas. Findings from the report will be disseminated through a workshop website as well as through presentations at international scientific conferences and meetings and national workforce policy summits.</AbstractNarration>
