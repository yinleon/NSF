    <AbstractNarration>William E. Bradshaw IOS-1048276&lt;br/&gt;New Genomic Approaches to the Evolution of Mosquito Physiology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary efforts in this research project focus on determining the physiological and genetic mechanisms that control the response of animals to rapid climate change. The work aims to show whether genetic (evolutionary) response to climate change has occurred by the alteration of existing genes or involves the recruitment of completely new genes. Determining the correct mechanism of response to rapid climate change is important for accurate prediction and mitigation of the spread of disease vectors from tropical to temperate zones, for agricultural development in the face of a changing world, and for conserving biodiversity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program takes advantage of the unique qualities of a small mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, that lives throughout much of eastern North America. W. smithii bites humans in some parts of its range and never bites humans in other parts of its range. This very unusual behavior will be exploited through a microarray-based expression analysis to identify the genes that alter expression of biting behavior in disease vectors such as mosquitoes. Finally, this small mosquito takes a long winter "nap". However, unlike typical animals that become dormant, W. smithii remains active, feeds and grows, but does not develop, even under ideal conditions. This resting period increases life span in this mosquito and may allow us to isolate novel genes that control longevity in humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has an ongoing commitment to involving minorities and undergraduates in all levels of research, with special emphasis on honors students engaging in original independent projects.</AbstractNarration>
