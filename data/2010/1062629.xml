    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Daniel M. Downey at James Madison University. The research projects supported in this site are in a wide range of areas of chemistry. Undergraduates will be recruited to this site from regional colleges and universities as well as James Madison University. The site will include participation from two outside mentors from other higher education institutions, as well as high school teachers and high school students. The site is unique in that it integrates deaf/hard of hearing researchers at every level (students and instructors). In addition, research students have the opportunity to teach chemistry to a large group of deaf/hard of hearing middle school youngsters taking part in a summer camp on the JMU campus. The site will support eight undergraduate research students per summer in a ten week program, in addition to supporting a number of visiting faculty and high-school teachers. A sample of the projects that researchers will work on include: (1) the synthesis and study of the supramolecular aggregation of novel amphiphiles; (2) the study of the solid state decomposition kinetics using metal-oxide nanoparticle catalysts; (3) the analysis of fish otoliths for trace amounts of toxic heavy metals as well as a study looking for endocrine disrupting compounds in natural waters; (4) the development of sensitive and accurate greenhouse gas sensors; (5) spectroscopic studies of nucleotide binding proteins and (6) the study of interfacial electron transfer in biomolecular systems. In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities, including training in scientific communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training. This REU site aims to provide students without significant research experience a chance to conduct cutting-edge research in the chemical sciences with dedicated faculty mentors at this predominantly undergraduate institution. The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for further study in the chemical sciences, and graduate school, with eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce. A unique feature of this REU site is the intensive integration of deaf students and faculty with the hearing majority. Students participating in this site will learn to communicate science effectively to both groups, and deaf/hard of hearing students will be encouraged to enter or continue study in STEM areas.</AbstractNarration>
