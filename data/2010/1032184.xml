    <AbstractNarration>In the wake of the January 12, 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the objective of this RAPID proposal is to test the hypothesis that infrastructure rehabilitation priorities based on local knowledge elicited through stakeholder driven processes will differ fundamentally from those developed by technical experts based outside the impacted area. In the recent literature, Easterly (2007), for example, contrasts the "planner's" approach to development aid with that of the "searcher." While "planners" make decisions about how to apply development aid assuming that they already know the answers, "searchers" admit not knowing the answer up front, and exert much effort to seek innovative solutions based on a detailed assessment of local opportunities and constraints based on close interaction with local population. To test the hypothesis, the research will focus on water and sanitation issues in Leogane, a town of approximately 40,000 people located about 30 km to the west of the capital and very near the quake's epicenter. The findings are anticipated to have implications on many imminent decisions regarding Haitian reconstruction efforts as well as for the development of new multifunctional infrastructure strategies throughout the world. The co-PIs include a social scientist who is an expert in Haitian culture, politics, and history. The other three PI/co-PIs are engineers who are expert in water infrastructure. All have international experience in developing countries, and all have French language skills. Two consultants on the team are Haitian nationals and Leogane natives with intimate knowledge of the City and fluency in Kreyol. The effort integrates education and outreach into the research plan, and will contribute critical information to the Haitian reconstruction effort. Participants in a local Leogane Stakeholder Committee will partake in cross-cutting discussions about key infrastructure issues, which will enable them to more actively participate in local infrastructure decision making. Two Drexel graduate students will incorporate the results of the field findings and elicitation exercises into their thesis work. The results of the research will be disseminated at an upcoming special NSF sponsored workshop on Haiti, and will be presented at conferences and submitted for publication in peer reviewed journals. In addition, arrangements have been made for liaison with USAID and CDC. Results will be used to create new Engineers Without Borders (EWB) projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is urgent because of the rapid pace at which decisions about how to invest hundreds of millions of dollars of post quake development Haiti aid are being made. IRB review and approval has been received for this award. The proposing team has made specific arrangements for transportation, housing, food, and water in Haiti.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering, Americas Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bruce Hamilton&lt;br/&gt;3/11/10</AbstractNarration>
