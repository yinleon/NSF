    <AbstractNarration>The PI requests funding for expansion of the mooring shop capabilities at the University of Alaska - Fairbanks, Seward Marine Center. This proposal focuses on expansion of the existing mooring shop and upgrades to an existing outside storage for mooring equipment to avoid a reduction in work. The current building is operating above full capacity for the existing funded projects. Expansion of the mooring shop offers potential to better serve the interdisciplinary nature of modern oceanographic moorings and programs. The mooring shop currently supports projects funded by NSF, NOAA, NPRB, NMFS, SAAMS and MMS. Other groups that currently service moorings in Alaskan waters include the Prince William Sound Science Center (PWSSC), and participants in the oil and gas industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biggest broader impact of this proposal is one of facilitating science for the broader oceanographic community through supporting data acquisition, which is used by others. The field station has demonstrated a commitment to community outreach and broad dissemination through various activities such as hosting conferences on ocean law and policy, supporting elderhostel events, public clinics and meetings, including participation by scout groups and various civic clubs). They host the regional (and once the national) Ocean Science Bowl competitions. This activity reaches many underrepresented populations. They have also hosted AK Science Learning Center's ROV class, which is an activity directly relevant to this proposal. They propose to use local students from a vocational school to help build the moorings and use the data.</AbstractNarration>
