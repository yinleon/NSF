    <AbstractNarration>Carnegie Mellon University is adding three new cohorts to its existing Scholarship for Service (SFS) program. Carnegie Mellon has earned an international reputation for its expertise and capability in information assurance research and education. The university's CyLab draws on the largest pool of academic cyber security researchers in the nation and combines top-ranked programs in computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, human-computer interaction, privacy technology and law, and policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SFS scholarships are awarded to students in either of two master's degree programs: the MS in Information Security Technology and Management and the MS in Information Security Policy and Management. Carnegie Mellon proposes to add a third master's degree program - the Pittsburgh-Silicon Valley MS in Information Technology and Information Security. The curricula of these programs have been certified pursuant to the Information Assurance Courseware Evaluation Process of the National Security Agency's CNSS 4011 - National Training Standard for Information Systems Security (INFOSEC) Professionals and CNSS 4014 - Information Assurance Training Standard for Information Systems Security Officers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carnegie Mellon University has been an active and enthusiastic participant in the SFS program since the program's inception. To date, 104 highly qualified students have graduated from the program, have been placed into federal information assurance positions, and make substantial contributions to the efforts of securing the Federal Government's cyberspace.</AbstractNarration>
