    <AbstractNarration>Hangelbroek&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1047694&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The goal of this project is to develop new tools and&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for effective kernel approximation on Euclidean&lt;br/&gt;domains and certain compact manifolds. This work includes two&lt;br/&gt;important aspects. The first is to develop schemes to treat&lt;br/&gt;highly nonuniform arrangements of data (with approximation rates&lt;br/&gt;controlled by a parameter reflecting the local density of the&lt;br/&gt;data). The second is to devise nonlinear schemes that&lt;br/&gt;approximate using linear combinations of very few kernels. &lt;br/&gt;Schemes developed abide by two features of mainstream&lt;br/&gt;approximation theory (features that have generally been elusive&lt;br/&gt;for kernel-based approximation schemes): they provide&lt;br/&gt;approximation that is precise, by providing convergence rates&lt;br/&gt;dictated by the smoothness of the approximand, and they are&lt;br/&gt;universal, by treating approximands at all levels of smoothness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The use of kernels to treat scattered, high-dimensional data&lt;br/&gt;is, by now, an established methodology in approximation theory. &lt;br/&gt;Kernels are especially prized for their ability to approximate in&lt;br/&gt;the absence of underlying geometrical structures, like meshes or&lt;br/&gt;triangulations. At this point there exist several algorithms&lt;br/&gt;employing kernels to treat large datasets that have been sampled&lt;br/&gt;almost uniformly. However, the approximation power of such&lt;br/&gt;algorithms -- judged in terms of the fidelity of the approximant&lt;br/&gt;to the approximand -- is rarely completely understood. &lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the question of how to treat highly nonuniform data&lt;br/&gt;(data with large gaps, or with points that coalesce) using&lt;br/&gt;kernels is only beginning to be addressed. An important goal of&lt;br/&gt;this project is to develop kernel-based approximation methods&lt;br/&gt;that approximate from highly unstructured datasets and that&lt;br/&gt;approximate high-dimensional datasets with little computational&lt;br/&gt;overhead. Another goal is to acquire a precise understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the approximation power of such methods. Of particular interest&lt;br/&gt;are problems where there is some underlying geometric or&lt;br/&gt;algebraic structure to be exploited, as, for example, is the case&lt;br/&gt;in problems in geodesy, crystallography, and molecular biology.</AbstractNarration>
