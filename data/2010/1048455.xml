    <AbstractNarration>The PIs have requested a RAPID award to continue development their prototype in-situ instrumentation capable of measuring spectral fluorescence (the excitation emission fluorometer (XMF) and the spectral fluorescence sensor (SAFire)) to aid in the tracking of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deepwater Horizon oil spill has generated a demonstrable and urgent need for in-situ verification of crude oil presence at all depths in seawater, the effect of dispersants, and an in-situ methodology to study the molecular transformations crude oil undergoes as it weathers, is dispersed, and is acted upon by biota. The results from this project will be used to develop an upgrade path to transform current, low-cost, in-situ sensors developed for other parameters into effective crude oil tracking instruments. These advanced sensors could be used to track changes in the Gulf spill over the long term, would be appropriate for various autonomous observational platforms, provide real-time field affirmation of crude oil presence, and be readily available for future crude oil sensing applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will identify optimal fluorescence pairs needed to provide refined and low-cost multi-spectral UV/VIS sensors for studying the fate and impacts of crude oil in the environment. This, and the study results, will directly improve our ability to accurately track oil in the natural ocean environment, providing for a better assessment of the impacts of the current spill and thereby improve response if needed in the future. The conclusions drawn from this study may have far reaching impacts in that they will add to the body of knowledge society can draw upon to manage natural resources. Additionally, this work will provide valuable research experience for the PI, a Post- Doctoral scientist, as a beginning young investigator.</AbstractNarration>
