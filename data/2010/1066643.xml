    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this EAGER grant is to seek seed funding for the proof-of-concept demonstration through fabrication; testing and measurement of nanodiamond?ragioregular polyhexylthiophene (RRPHTh) conjugated polymer nanohybrid organic photovoltaic cell. Our approach is to fabricate the photovoltaic device consisting of conducting/ND-conjugated polymer/Electrolyte/Graphene/Conducting and Al/ND-RRPHThs/Graphene/conducting electrode structures. The film of nanodiamond-RRPHTh, and homologues conducting polymer structured will be exploited for fabrication of efficient organic photovoltaic cell. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The research will develop for the first time, the photovoltaic device using nanodiamond- RRPHTh or ND-other homologous conjugated polymers nanohybrid film over entire solar spectrum. The target of the work is to enhance photoelectrochemical and solid photovoltaic (PV) effect, and eliminate the recombination of photo induced charge carriers. The investigators will analyze and compare the device with existing technologies. We will also investigate and design a new generation efficient photovoltaic cells to increase the efficiency than observed in any organic based photovoltaic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Successful completion of this investigation will result photovoltaic materials displaying of high photovoltaic efficiency at low cost. This innovative research will also meet individual soldier energy requirements, communications, building and facility energy requirements and space-based electric power systems. The market that can be addressed by the proposed technology will be over $1.5B by 2013. The project will provide a unique opportunity for the students and postdocs to be involved in the interdisciplinary research. An essential and important component of this research will be the dissemination of the result through patent, publications in journals and presentations in conferences.</AbstractNarration>
