    <AbstractNarration>Currently, there is a growing need to bridge the divide between technological advances and applications of new technologies to in situ ecological studies. This is particularly true in freshwater ecology where field conditions often inhibit use of fragile instrumentation or status quo techniques are assumed to be adequate. New microelectrode instrumentation is being constructed for expanded use in ecological studies. Because microelectrodes have great potential for advancing ecology through a better understanding of microbial processes and chemical dynamics, this instrumentation development fills a void in ecology currently needed in multiple research areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Microelectrodes being constructed include oxygen, sulfide, and nitrous oxide microelectrodes uniquely packaged specifically for in situ applications. This newly developed instrumentation is tested in a distinctive ecosystem in the Mojave Desert, which is home to the endangered Devils Hole pupfish (approximately 100 individuals remaining). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Newly developed microelectrode instrumentation will also be packaged as a mobile unit for broad dissemination and use in myriad applications by other interested researchers. It is expected that more than ten researchers will use this new instrumentation within the first two years of the project with continued availability after the project duration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expected outcomes of these activities include expanded use of microelectrodes in ecology, which would enable development of strategies for conservation, for example in the case of the Devils Hole pupfish.
