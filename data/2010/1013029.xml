    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, Prof. Kim Williams and her group at the Colorado School of Mines seek increased understanding of the relationship between thermal diffusion and analyte-solvent parameters in the context of thermal field-flow fractionation (ThFFF), with aims of developing methods that address new measurement challenges posed by nanoscale materials. Extensive systematic studies with different polymer chemistries and architectures (linear chains, combs, dendrimers, stars, and bottle brushes) and nanoparticles functionalized with these polymers are included, as are new ThFFF channel designs that can significantly reduce analysis times and energy consumption while providing a potential route to semipreparative scale separations. The ability to collect larger amounts of well defined narrow dispersity polymers and nanoparticles will be a boon to unraveling property-function relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities will advance knowledge and understanding within analytical chemistry and across different fields. Through the development of novel analytical methods for nanoscale materials, this project can impact diverse areas such as separations, synthesis of new materials, and renewable energy. The ability to monitor reactions will provide insight into synthesis pathways and facilitate reaction optimization for targeted products. Understanding the relative role of specific nanomaterials properties in controlling end properties (e.g., the influence of nanoparticle size and surface chemistry on photoconversion efficiencies) will facilitate the design of novel nanostructures for solar cells. The program includes an outreach component geared towards K-12 science education in two Denver school districts with high numbers of minority and disadvantaged students.</AbstractNarration>
