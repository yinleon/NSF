    <AbstractNarration>Although many horticulturists and botanists are familiar with the economic aspects of somatic mutation, the role somatic mutation plays as a mechanism for evolutionary change is unknown. The modular and layered nature of plant tissues provides the basis for mutations to occur and be perpetuated through cell division and differentiation, potentially creating mosaics of genetic variability (within plant genetic variability). Genetically altered tissues can be perpetuated sexually through gametes or asexually through the production of tubers, bulbs, runners, rhizomes, and seeds, leading to the divergence of parental and somatically altered offspring. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In spite of wide acknowledgment that somatic mutation can occur, it is unknown how much variation can be generated and perpetuated within an individual plant. To address this issue we propose conducting a genome-wide scan of genetic (gene level) variation within different plant parts of the same individual (roots, stems, leaves) using the model plant system black cottonwood, Populus trichocarpa, and Illumina sequencing (resequencing), specifically addressing how common mutations are at the level of the gene within an individual. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, the results of this study will take an initial step toward resolving a long-standing debate over the importance of somatic mutations in nature and their evolutionary importance, including ways in which plants may be able to evolutionarily cope with changing environmental conditions and whether within plant genetic variation can prevent pests and pathogens from breaking the defenses of their host plants. One graduate and one undergraduate student will gain training in genomics and bioinformatics.</AbstractNarration>
