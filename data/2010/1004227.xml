    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site program is focused on multidisciplinary research in ecologically sustainable production and processing of biomass-derived fuels. The overarching objective of the proposed REU program will be to train talented undergraduate students in research methods appropriate for the conduct of state-of-the-art research in science and engineering. Specific goals of the program are to:(1) educate a diverse group of science and engineering undergraduate students about ecologically sustainable production and processing of biomass for biofuels;(2) train students to conduct high-quality research in science and engineering; and (3)motivate and prepare participants for graduate research and training in science and engineering. The program will be hosted at Iowa State University's (ISU) Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering (ABE) department a premiere program that is located in the biofuel "breadbasket" of the U.S. The project will support a ten-week immersive research experience for ten undergraduate students each summer for a period of three years. Undergraduate students will be trained to conduct high quality scientific research, and mentored by faculty and graduate students to seek out graduate education and career opportunities in science and engineering. Research and enrichment activities will focus on topics related to ecologically sustainable production and processing of biomass-derived fuels. This will be accomplished through: (1) an intensive experience in laboratory and/or field research; (2) exposure to state-of-the-art knowledge through multiple research seminars in biomass production, harvest, transport, storage, conversion, processing, and environmental stewardship associated with these steps; (3) education about various components of the biomass to biofuel agro industry complex through field trips; (4) professional development through a seminar series, ethics workshop, and travel to a national conference; and (5) networking and social development through a variety of community building activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biomass-derived fuels have emerged as a promising source of renewable energy with a potential to reduce energy imports while decreasing atmospheric emissions of fossil-fuel derived CO2. This REU Site program will educate the next generation of scientists and engineers about biomass-derived fuel production, train them to conduct high quality scientific research and inspire them to pursue graduate education with a potential to yield transformative technological innovations in sustainable energy production.</AbstractNarration>
