    <AbstractNarration>This project is supporting a national conversation about planning learning spaces that includes a colloquium, as well as a series of yearlong activities through which colloquium conversations are being extended, distilled, and disseminated. Participants include institutional leaders, faculty, and administrators responsible for shaping the intellectual and social learning environment (what and how students learn) and for shaping the physical learning environment (where students learn), who will be invited to the conversation. They are convening with architects and design, planning, and construction professionals responsible for translating institutional dreams and plans for learning spaces into physical reality. Beginning with and extending beyond the colloquium, the conversation are engaging pedagogical pioneers, cognitive scientists, reflective technologists, and others whose research and experiences can inform the discussion of what an ideal space for learning in the 21st Century should be.</AbstractNarration>
