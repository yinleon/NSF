    <AbstractNarration>In this pilot project the Principal Investigators, in collaboration with PhysioSim, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, are developing a software infrastructure on which to build a series of computer-based simulation/tutorials in physiology based on the "build-test-refine" mental model paradigm. This process is designed to help students recognize their current knowledge (current mental model), test that model, and refine it based on the results of the testing process. As a first step in "proof of concept" that on-line simulations will support this teaching approach, this project is creating and beta testing a simulation-based tutorial dealing with the events of the cardiac cycle. Seven Physiology Educational Research Consortium colleagues and their undergraduate physiology students are testing the tutorial, and then providing periodic feedback with respect to ease of use, appropriateness of the content, and any potential areas of confusion that may be generated by use of the tool. The institutions involved include: San Joaquin Delta College, Canisius College, Niagara University, Edmonds Community College, the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, Seattle University and the University of Washington. The intellectual merit of this pilot project is that it provides a concrete example of how the "build-test-refine" mental model pedagogy can be implemented in classroom practice. The broader impact of this effort lies in its potential to demonstrate that this approach is an effective strategy to help students engage in meaningful learning and, hence, promote conceptual change.</AbstractNarration>
