    <AbstractNarration>A large number of structural components in engineering can be classified as &lt;br/&gt;plates. Typical examples of civil engineering structures are floor and &lt;br/&gt;foundation slabs, lock-gates, thin retaining walls, bridge decks, and slab &lt;br/&gt;bridges. Plates are also indispensable in ship building, automobile, and &lt;br/&gt;aerospace industries. The stress resultants of a thin plate can be calculated &lt;br/&gt;through the 3-dimensional elasticity equations. However, under certain &lt;br/&gt;hypotheses, the 3-dimensional elasticity equations for a plate are reduced &lt;br/&gt;to the 2-dimensional equations. The Kirchhoff plate model is well suited for &lt;br/&gt;thin plates. However, the governing equation for the displacement of this &lt;br/&gt;plate model is the fourth order differential equation. The conventional finite &lt;br/&gt;element method is difficult to apply because of the complexity of &lt;br/&gt;constructing smooth finite elements. Furthermore, moderately thick plates have &lt;br/&gt;other difficulties such as boundary layer problems and shear locking &lt;br/&gt;problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Meshless methods (in which smooth flexible approximation functions are used &lt;br/&gt;and complicated mesh generation is not necessary) have several advantages &lt;br/&gt;over the conventional finite element method. However, these methods have &lt;br/&gt;several major limitations including the inefficiency in handling essential &lt;br/&gt;boundary conditions, large matrix condition numbers, and complexity in &lt;br/&gt;constructing partitions of unity. Most recently, the PI invented one of the &lt;br/&gt;most flexible closed form partition of unity, called the Generalized Product &lt;br/&gt;Partition of Unity. The PI proposes to introduce Meshfree particle methods &lt;br/&gt;by using the Generalized Product Partition of Unity, together with new local &lt;br/&gt;approximation functions that can handle geometric boundary conditions as well &lt;br/&gt;as force boundary conditions arising in various plate models. Furthermore, &lt;br/&gt;the PI proposes to apply Meshfree particle methods to obtain highly &lt;br/&gt;accurate stress analysis of plates and shells for design and maintenance of &lt;br/&gt;related engineering structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit: The proposed research will greatly improve the stress &lt;br/&gt;analysis of plates, shells, and laminated composite plates so that design and &lt;br/&gt;maintenance of automobiles, airplanes, ships, and all other engineering &lt;br/&gt;structures related to plates and shells may be more effective and safer. &lt;br/&gt;Moreover, without any difficulty, the proposed method is able to surgically &lt;br/&gt;make the approximation space enriched with any type of singular function. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed method is flexible and effective in dealing with singularities &lt;br/&gt;and it can be used for accurate prediction of crack propagation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts: Results from the proposed research can be used to design &lt;br/&gt;fuel efficient automobiles, safer airplanes, ships and new materials more &lt;br/&gt;resistant to failure. The proposed research can also be applied to improve &lt;br/&gt;maintenance of aging airliners, bridges, ships, buildings, and numerous other &lt;br/&gt;applications where structural integrity should be closely monitored. &lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, the proposed research will have direct impacts on the public &lt;br/&gt;safety and the environment by increasing efficiency and safety of common &lt;br/&gt;modes of transportation and structures used everyday.</AbstractNarration>
