    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The leap between classroom science and independent laboratory research is large, and advanced physics lab courses often represent a culminating experience in helping bridge this challenging transition within the physics curriculum. These courses impact attitudes and expectations about what a career in science will be like and seek to develop the scientific reasoning and laboratory skills that enable students to succeed in graduate school, industry, and other professional endeavors. This advanced optics/modern physics lab is being reformed through a research-based transformation to match this ideal, and they are sharing developments and findings with the broader physics community. Extensive reformed lab materials are under development for this formative course, and in addition they are bringing together a library of high-level advanced laboratory experiments and programs being developed at other institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The curricular outcomes of this two-year effort include: a suite of curricular materials for this formative advanced lab course, assessment instruments to evaluate the impact of upper level educational reforms, along with establishing instructional resources to assist faculty members not involved in this course transformation to continue these best lab practices. The research outcomes of this study include: operational definitions and assessments of student abilities that lead to successful careers in science, a study of the relevance of the advanced lab experience in impacting a student's career goals, preliminary studies of student learning in upper-division lab courses, and an evaluation of faculty use of these new research-based curricula and practices. A broad national impact is anticipated as materials being produced are made freely available online and as these workers participate actively in conferences and publications addressing this critical juncture of undergraduate physics teaching.</AbstractNarration>
