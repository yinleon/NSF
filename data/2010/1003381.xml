    <AbstractNarration>The project builds on earlier work of the PIs with "math machines" and expands the number of supporting applications and the use of these devices to other institutions. Math machines are simple physical devices that give an immediate, dynamic expression to abstract mathematical functions. They focus on brief activities for standard math and science classes rather than large-scale extracurricular projects. They feature precise control rather than dramatic speed, and they use explicit student-designed mathematical functions to achieve physical results. Through this project, math machines are extended to use new computer controls to supplement the original calculator controls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project expands nationally to provide each of 40 community college teachers of math and physics with two new math machines. It provides community colleges with the ability to produce their own math machines and to train high school and college faculty in their use. The project produces, tests, revises and disseminates 20 new classroom activities and improves and enhances existing software. The PIs evaluate the impact of math machines on student learning, on student and teacher attitudes, and on the dynamics of interdisciplinary cooperation within and between institutions. Additional features include support for National Instruments interfaces to supplement the current support for Vernier Software and Technology and Texas Instruments calculators.</AbstractNarration>
