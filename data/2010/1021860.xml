    <AbstractNarration>In developing brain, growing the extensions of the nerve cells (neurons) is critical to establish interneuronal connections underlying brain functions. Dendrites are the branched type of such extensions and form the input connection of a neuron. Dendritic growth is stimulated by extracellular cues including a protein, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor, and electrical activity of the developing neurons. In the receptive neurons, such stimulating signals activate a cascade of intracellular events that culminates in the growth response. The general goal of this proposal is to identify critical elements of the molecular network underlying dendritic growth. The nucleolus is a subdomain of the cell nucleus, and genes within the nucleolus encode ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a critical component of the protein synthesis machines known as ribosomes. The hypothesis of this proposal is to test whether expression of nucleolar genes regulates dendritic growth. Using whole rat pups and cultured rat forebrain neurons, this hypothesis will be addressed by (i) defining the intracellular molecular signaling events critical for regulation of nucleolar gene expression by signals that increase dendritic growth, (ii) determining whether nucleolar gene expression is required and sufficient to mediate dendritic growth in response to such signals, and, finally, (iii) testing the importance of making new ribosomes for the dendritic growth. This project may identify a previously unrecognized role of the nucleolus in the development of the nervous system. The project will also actively engage undergraduate students some of whom will be recruited from a geographical region in which college-educated individuals are underrepresented.</AbstractNarration>
