    <AbstractNarration>This research program is developing inquiry-based animated case studies of complex physiological processes (diffusion, osmosis and filtration) and critically assessing their effect on student learning when introduced into large introductory college biology classes. This study is being designed to determine if students using animated case studies, when compared to those using only still images abstracted from the animations, will: (1) have greater learning gains regarding the dynamic nature of the physiological processes, and (2) be more engaged in science. Qualitative observations are being used to gauge student engagement in the case studies. Feedback from students participating in this study is being used to improve the existing case studies and to identify other physiological processes to serve as the focus of future case studies for introductory biology classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project is providing critical information for animation designers, teachers, science education researchers, and curriculum designers. As a consequence, the outcomes of this study will advance the current knowledge base in several fields, and have the potential to be transformative on how complex biological processes are taught. New insights into why and when animated case studies lead to better student learning than case studies containing still images is an important potential contribution of this study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The results of this study could be relevant not only for science instructors, science education researchers, and curriculum designers, but also for animation and educational game designers and could contribute to establishing new guidelines for the design of animations used in the science classroom, and for the assessment of learning with animations. In addition, by incorporating the animated case studies into the introductory biology curriculum, interested biology students will be recruited to collaborate with science education and animation undergraduate students in the planning and design of new animated processes, highlighting other biological processes that students find difficult to master. The animations and research findings will be presented at national and international biology professional society meetings including those of the American Physiological Society and at Science Education Research conferences. The designers of the animations will present them at national Digital Media conferences. The graduate and undergraduate students will present their research findings in departmental seminars and at statewide conferences. Partnership with Morehouse College broadens the spectrum of students and faculty involved.</AbstractNarration>
