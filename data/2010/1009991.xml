    <AbstractNarration>This award will support a project to obtain and analyze time-series data at infrared wavelengths. There are many advantages that infrared observations have over studies at visible wavelengths. These include better data on cool stars, such as red extragalactic transients and young stars, and amelioration of the effects of interstellar dust. The goals of this project are several: characterization of variability using large existing and proposed datasets; a targeted campaign on extragalactic cluster environments; a study of roughly 100 pulsating variables (RR Lyrae, Cepheids, and Miras); a systematic study and analysis of Type Ia and Type II-P supernovae in the infrared; and rapid observations of several gamma-ray bursts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will create a web portal to rapidly disseminate the results of this study to the astronomical community and to the general public. In addition, the team will make almost seven years of historical infrared time-domain data public with the archive and web portal. Finally, Dr. Bloom will be actively engaged in mentorship of the undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars involved in the project.</AbstractNarration>
