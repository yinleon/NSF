    <AbstractNarration>This REU site brings eight undergraduate students to Rutgers each&lt;br/&gt;summer for a ten-week research internship in the area of perceptual&lt;br/&gt;science and technology. This research area centers on the challenges&lt;br/&gt;and opportunities of building novel computational models that systems&lt;br/&gt;may use to understand their environment and act intelligently in it.&lt;br/&gt;The area affords a range of research methods, including designing&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, building systems, gathering and analyzing data, and&lt;br/&gt;understanding intelligence in its human context. Research projects&lt;br/&gt;cover topics such as: computational approaches to the perception and&lt;br/&gt;recognition of objects, faces, scenes, depth and motion; perceptual&lt;br/&gt;categorization and perceptual decisions; data mining and statistical&lt;br/&gt;analysis of perceptual input; search, attention, and visuo-motor&lt;br/&gt;learning; visual experiences in human-computer interaction; and&lt;br/&gt;computational depiction and design. The site strives to recruit and&lt;br/&gt;support interns from underrepresented populations and to foster&lt;br/&gt;collaborative research. Accepted students work closely with a faculty&lt;br/&gt;mentor from drafting a project plan through carrying out and&lt;br/&gt;presenting their research. Each project includes a pathway for two or&lt;br/&gt;more interns to bring different results, data, or methods to bear on a&lt;br/&gt;shared problem. The site holds workshops on research practice,&lt;br/&gt;research ethics, skills for collaboration, and careers in perceptual&lt;br/&gt;science and technology. Social events reinforce the sense of&lt;br/&gt;community. The integrative, collaborative focus of the site offers&lt;br/&gt;interns a deeper sense of range of the different careers, topics and&lt;br/&gt;work environments available to them, and allows them to fine-tune a&lt;br/&gt;match between their research plans and their personal goals,&lt;br/&gt;backgrounds, and interests. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program</AbstractNarration>
