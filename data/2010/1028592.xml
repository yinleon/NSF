    <AbstractNarration>This project uses contemporary whaling as a case study for the&lt;br/&gt;"natureculture" framework, a term used in anthropology to refer to&lt;br/&gt;lifeways particularly marked by inseparable binding between nature and&lt;br/&gt;culture. Such binding is an obvious description for the Makah, a native&lt;br/&gt;American group in which whaling is an ancient and culturally central&lt;br/&gt;practice. But could the same claim for a cultural right to whaling apply&lt;br/&gt;to a modern Japanese whale harvest? What about environmentalists who see&lt;br/&gt;their cultural identity formed around whale defense? Just as cognitive&lt;br/&gt;dissonance describes the discomfort and resulting behaviors that occur&lt;br/&gt;when one holds two or more psychologically incompatible ideas,&lt;br/&gt;natureculture dissonance describes the discomfort and resulting&lt;br/&gt;behaviors when there is a clash between incompatible naturecultures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates how each of 3 groups (Makah, Japanese, and&lt;br/&gt;Environmentalist) mobilizes resources (ranging from rhetorical resources&lt;br/&gt;to harpoons to cultural capital) in response to this dissonance, using ethnographic methods. Rather than reduce the conflict to a simplistic ethical calculus &lt;br/&gt;(for example the claim that animal rights universally trump human need), this project emphasizes the complex synthesis that each natureculture represents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project goal is to use these fuller, more dynamic portraits to develop an "enviroculturalist" framework that can encompass &lt;br/&gt;the value of cultural diversity as well as that of biodiversity, and produce a more nuanced understanding of transcultural environmental conflicts, &lt;br/&gt;leading to improved management of environmental systems.</AbstractNarration>
