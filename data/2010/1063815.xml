    <AbstractNarration>The proposal requests support for student travel to the 49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), which will be held in Atlanta, Georgia, December 15-17, 2010. The IEEE&lt;br/&gt;CDC is the annual flagship conference of the IEEE Control Systems Society and one of the premier international conferences in the field of control theory and applications. The funds will provide partial support for up to twenty students from US colleges and universities to attend the conference and present their research results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Control theory is ubiquitous in modern, complex, technological systems, from automotive to aerospace systems, biomedical systems, industrial automation systems, robotics, and a host of other systems. It is increasingly evident that current research on many technological frontiers is heavily influenced by foundational ideas from control and system theory. The 49th IEEE CDC received over 2100 submissions and accepted around 1100 for presentation, many of which are co-authored by students together with their faculty advisers. The intellectual merit of the proposed use of funds is that graduate students will see how the foundations of control and systems are evolving and shaping the frontiers of research in many applications domains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT: With over 1100 research presentations, including several plenary lectures, workshops and exhibits the CDC provides attendees with exposure to the state-of-the-art in emerging areas of control research and technology. The broader impact of this travel support is that it will help train the next generation of control researchers and practitioners. The future security and well-being of the United States relies on maintaining pools of trained scientists and engineers in critical areas such as control technology. The students to be supported under the proposed project represent the future technological leaders of the IEEE Control Systems Society, which is the world?s leading professional organization in the discipline.</AbstractNarration>
