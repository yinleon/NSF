    <AbstractNarration>This workshop contributes to the advancement and development of research in decision, risk, and management sciences (DRMS). The DRMS Program at NSF supports research on a broad range of topics such as confidence in eyewitness memory, climate change scenarios, the application of neurosciences to decision research, risk perceptions and behaviors, and genetic influences on morality. The scholars who do this work have diverse backgrounds such as economics, psychology, political science, and neuroscience. They are part of the DRMS community, but they rarely come together to share ideas about the future of DRMS research. The intention of the workshop is to stimulate the creation of new teams that have the potential to produce transformative work through both interchanges at the event and publications emanating from the workshop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop addresses the broader impacts of DRMS research as well as its intellectual merit. One emphasis is on strategies to increase the participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in DRMS research.</AbstractNarration>
