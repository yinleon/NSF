    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to support and enhance engineering innovation through identifying the cognitive benefits of physical representations (such as prototypes) in the design process. The research on idea generation with physical models and on the use of prototypes in the design process is very limited. The benefits and limitations of physical representations to support the early phases of design will be identified. Two key hypotheses will be evaluated. The first is that physical models cause design fixation. The second is that physical models assist in overcoming inaccuracies in designers' mental models resulting in a larger number of functional, feasible ideas. These key research questions will be investigated through a combination of qualitative and quantitative studies of undergraduate mechanical and practicing engineers. Answering the key research question will provide a basis for design methods development for industry and engineering education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will improve the methods and tools available to engineers thus increasing their ability to solve critical design problems. The results of this research will enhance the understanding of how physical representation effect engineering cognition, provide guidelines for their use within idea generation and develop novel design approaches to support innovation. Results of the research will provide new design principles and methods of use in industry and education. Novel design methods based on the fundamental cognitive and design principles defined in this proposal will be directly integrated into undergraduate and graduate design classes. The new methods for innovation will be applied in developing sustainable, appropriate technology while working with a community service group and workshops on teaching innovation in engineering education are planned. In addition, class modules for enhancing student innovation skills will be created.</AbstractNarration>
