    <AbstractNarration>The oceans are integral to climate regulation, nutrient production, oil retrieval and transportation. As such, there is significant interest in monitoring aquatic environments for scientific, environmental, commercial, safety, and military reasons. While there is a need for highly precise, real-time, fine grained spatiotemporal sampling of the ocean environment, current methods such as remote telemetry and sequential local sensing cannot satisfy current requirements, let alone future ones. The notion of an underwater network is relatively new due to the lack of maturity of underwater acoustic communications. However, networks are critical in order to achieve the monitoring goals noted above. The physical challenges of acoustic underwater communication and the complexity of diverse aquatic environments require us to completely re-think how a network should be deployed in underwater environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the First, Second, Third, and Fourth ACM International Workshops on Underwater Networks (WUWNet) that took place in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009, the Fifth ACM WUWNet - WUWNet 2010 - will be held in Woods Hole, MA, September 30 - October 1, 2010. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal's main goal is to foment graduate student participation in the WUWNet 2010 workshop by students that might normally find it difficult to attend. The funding will be used to support the travel and attendance costs of the selected students. Participation in the workshop is expected to benefit the experience of a graduate program, providing students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and peer graduate students, to be exposed to leading edge work in the field, and take part in discussions that are likely to shape the future of the field. Criteria will include evidence of research in underwater communication and networking, and/or a serious interest in underwater communication and networking as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience. Women and minorities will be given preference when other qualifications are similar.</AbstractNarration>
