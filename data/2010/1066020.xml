    <AbstractNarration>The investigator will study multi-parameter analogs of the Calderón-Zygmund theory of singular integrals, which significantly generalize the well-known product theory of singular integrals. A critical starting point will be the case of multi-parameter Carnot-Carathéodory (or sub-Riemannian) geometry (a geometry defined by vector fields). There is already a reasonable conjecture as to the analog of a Calderón-Zygmund singular integral in the context of Carnot-Carathéodory geometry: a conjecture which generalizes a number of known and useful types of singular integrals. The Calderón-Zygmund theory of singular integrals has found numerous applications in a wide range of mathematics. However, when the underlying geometry is multi-parameter, there is no known analog of the Calderón-Zygmund theory (outside of the product-type situation). Recent work shows that an analog might be in reach when the underlying geometry is given by a multi-parameter Carnot-Carathéodory geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harmonic analysis, and more specifically the theory of singular integrals, has found a wide variety of applications in other areas of mathematics, physics, finance, and biology. The diverse methods in harmonic analysis offer the promise of many future applications in the sciences. The research in this project, in particular, has several connections to other areas of mathematics, finance, and mathematical physics. Most directly, it has applications to the theory of several complex variables. More generally, it applies to partial differential equations defined by vector fields: a theory which has implications in mathematical finance and fluid dynamics. One of the main current obstacles in the application of the theory of singular integrals to various questions is that there is no suitable "multi-parameter" theory adapted to the particular application. The main purpose of this project is to develop such a theory, which would be useful in a wide variety of situations--potentially addressing a number of open questions. The project will help continue an active research and training group in harmonic analysis--especially harmonic analysis with applications to partial differential equations--at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This includes many active discussions and collaborations with graduate students and visiting postdoctoral scholars.</AbstractNarration>
