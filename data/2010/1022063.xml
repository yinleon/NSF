    <AbstractNarration>Doctoral student Ana Maria Vinea (Graduate Center of the City University of New York), under the supervision of Dr. Talal Asad, will undertake research on the relationship between traditional healing practices and modern medicine in contemporary Islamic societies. The focus of the research will be contemporary cultural models of mental disease, which involves a complex nexus of diagnoses, treatments, and institutions. Her focus will be on Quaranic healing and exorcism, which is increasingly popular today even though people have other choices including western psychiatric methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be be carried out in Cairo, Egypt. The researcher will concentrate on three aspects of Quranic healing that constitute points of controversy in present-day debates: (1) the conceptualization of human psychology; (2) conceptualizations of the nature of interactions between humans and jinns (spirits); and (3) the employment of Quranic verses for healing purposes. The researcher will employ a mixture of social science research methodologies to gather data: analysis of a variety of media and archival sources; semi-structured interviews with psychiatrists, health officials, religious scholars, and Quranic healers; observations of the healing sessions of Quranic healers; and collection of illness narratives from patients. The data will be used to address the following questions: What affective dispositions and notions of normality are articulated in debates on mental disorders and how are they affected by the encounter of different treatment methods? On what bases do the actors involved make authoritative claims about mental disorders and what ideas do people invoke about Islamic orthodoxy, superstition, and science? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is important because it will contribute to building better theories of the dynamic relationship between different kinds of medical practices. Findings from the research also will help to devise culturally sensitive approaches to mental health treatment for Muslims in Egypt and elsewhere. Funding this research contributes to the training of a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>
