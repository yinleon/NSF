    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to conduct rigorous mathematical analysis of complex networks of interconnected dynamical systems, and apply the developed methods to control and collectively synchronize arrays of coupled semiconductor lasers. The main idea is based on the dynamical, rather than traditional static, description of the topology of a network, which allows to account for an analysis and evaluation of cumulative action of all three major ingredients that form a dynamical network: 1. local dynamics of elements of the network, 2. interactions between the elements of a network, 3. topology of the network. The project seeks an integration of the mathematical foundations with real world applications, and the developed mathematical machinery will be used to find synchronization conditions and to choose control parameters for synchronization of arrays of coupled semiconductor lasers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will advance the fields of complex dynamical networks, nonlinear dynamics, and coupled semiconductor lasers, and provide theoretical guidance for laser experiments that may lead to significant technological impact in applications of semiconductor lasers such as space, fiber, and underwater communication, welding, cutting and others. The project integrates research projects with education activities through undergraduate and graduate education and research training, short course and workshop development, and outreach to K-12 education. The team also plans to recruit women engineering students and to retain them into careers in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
