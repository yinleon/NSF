    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research Objectives and Approaches: The objective of this research is to create a new class of thermophotovoltaic cells cells that convert thermal radiation (heat) into electricity that harness wide-ranging heat temperatures frequently occurring in home appliances, factories, and during electricity generation. The approach is to use recent advances in infrared photodetectors, developed in part by the PI, which maximize conversion of light into electrical current. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Thermophotovoltaics convert energy efficiently, but have traditionally not been able to convert photons of wavelengths &gt;3-microns, meaning that only very hot sources (&gt;1500Â°C) can be used. The work proposed explores substitution of bulk materials with strained-layer superlattices, and replacing the traditional pin-photodiode with a new barrier-based design, called pBn, which reduce Auger and Shockley-Read-Hall recombination rates, respectively. This could allow for thermal-energy conversion even at temperatures approaching body heat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: In addition to creating a new course on the benefits and limitations of green energy technologies at Tufts, this grant will enhance the opportunity for students to apply and expand upon the knowledge they have gained in the classroom and utilize it in a research setting. The PI is dedicated to training the next generation of engineers and scientists for this country, with a focus on underrepresented groups. The proposed creation of universally accessibly web- and museum-based green-energy animations could help inspire underrepresented groups to pursue jobs in science or engineering. Increased energy efficiency of power-generation, and potentially every device that uses electricity, would elicit profound, widespread societal and economic effects.</AbstractNarration>
