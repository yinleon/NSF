    <AbstractNarration>This project provides recipients of the NSF?s Division of Undergraduate Education, Office of Cyberinfrastructure and Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering grants, an opportunity to present their research to a wider community. These presentations are taking place at the annual SIGCSE Symposium. This showcase highlights the old Course, Curriculum &amp; Laboratory Improvement Program (CCLI) grants as well as the program that replaced it, Transforming Undergraduate Education in Science (TUES), the Cyberinfrastructure Training, Education, Advancement, and Mentoring for Our 21st Century Workforce (CI-TEAM) and the CISE Pathways to Revitalized Undergraduate Computing Education (CPATH) projects. In addition, the showcase has a number of opportunities for potential grant writers to speak to NSF program officers about their grant ideas. The PIs of this proposal are organizing and promoting a showcase of NSF projects at the SIGCSE Symposiums for 2011 to 2013. We intend for 20 different PIs presenting at each showcase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SIGCSE Symposium is an international conference held annually in the United States, and it is one of the few dedicated solely to issues of undergraduate computing education. The conference attracts over 1000 educators from North America with a growing worldwide participation. The audience that the conference attracts is the same audience that the CCLI/TUES, CI-TEAM and CPATH programs reach out toward. Thus, this showcase allows for the PIs to present their work to an appropriate group of individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Creating a worthy NSF proposal is a difficult task. The goal of the showcase is also to contribute to improve upon the quality of proposals that are currently submitted. It achieves this by allowing showcase attendees to see the existing grants that have been funded, as well as speak to the NSF program officers about their individual funding ideas. This is having the effect of increasing the quality of future proposals.</AbstractNarration>
