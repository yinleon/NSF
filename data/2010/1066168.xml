    <AbstractNarration>Smart Infrastructure (SI) is the infrastructure composed of materials or structures that can sense the environmental or status changes and adapt to the changes for positive effects. It may simply consist of smart materials that can adapt to temperature changes or stress status, or a structure that includes smart sensors to help the structure to perform adaptations. SI technologies have resulted from the integration and deployment of innovative technologies developed from several NSF initiatives on sensing technology, information technology, high performance materials, cyber infrastructure, and computational science and engineering. Applications of SI technologies to transportation infrastructure are emerging and require vision development and multidisciplinary collaborations of researchers in the areas of smart technologies, sensor development and deployment, computational simulation, and transportation infrastructure design, construction, operation and maintenance. The objectives of this workshop are to 1) brain storm on and present vision and perspectives for smart and resilient transportation infrastructure; 2) identify promising technologies and tools for smart transportation infrastructure; 3) identify barriers and research needs for developing smart transportation infrastructure; and 4) discuss potential national and international collaborations for a partnership among academic institutions, industries and governmental agencies. It is anticipated that the outcome of the workshop would include the development of a systematical outline for directions of future research, development, deployment and education; and provision of a forum for researchers in different disciplines to team up for synergistic programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smart and resilient transportation infrastructure is critical to the economy and security of the nation. Systematic research, development and education in this area may lead to industrial innovations and high-tech job opportunities. The proceeding planed for the workshop may serve as a visional document to guide graduate research and education, which may lead to potential joint offer of graduate courses resulted from collaborations of participants. The multidisciplinary graduate education program may present impact on training future generations of engineers with expertise on multi-technology synthesis and entrepreneurship development.</AbstractNarration>
