    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Andrew Greenberg at the University of Wisconsin - Madison for three summers, commencing in 2010. The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program. The research projects focus on chemical research applied to problems in renewable energy. Sample projects include: (1) synthesis and study of nanowire based photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical materials made from earth-abundant materials; (2) the synthesis and study of surface-tethered metal complexes for electrocatalytic oxidation of water; (3) the development of new kinds of polymeric materials for energy applications (fuel storage, ion conductors, etc.); (4) the template assembly of anisometric nanorods for solar energy collection; and (5) the development of nanostructured materials for energy applications. In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities. In addition, they will be encouraged to participate in mentoring of middle school students taking part in the Institute for Chemical Education Chemistry Camp. Undergraduate research students will be recruited nationally, and the site will fund no students from the University of Wisconsin - Madison. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training. This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in the chemical sciences to a large number of students who might not otherwise have this opportunity. The research projects are in areas of chemistry that will have an impact in the areas of energy and sustainability. The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>
