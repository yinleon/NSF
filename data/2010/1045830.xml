    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop commercially viable processes to fabricate low-cost large-area transparent conducting films (TCFs) using solution phase synthesis and self-assembly on both rigid and flexible substrates. Material synthesis, nanomaterial dispersion formulation and deposition techniques will be studied to improve both the transparency and conductivity of the TCFs to be competitive with commonly used transparent conductors such as Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide low-cost, highly-conductive and transparent films as a replacement of ITO. Such TCFs can be used in a broad range of commercial applications including liquid crystal displays (LCD), plasma displays, touch screens, organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), antistatic coatings, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and photovoltaics. The processes and methods to be developed would also improve the understanding of the material interactions at the nanoscale and impact other technical areas such as printing electronics.</AbstractNarration>
