    <AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences (ECS) program of the Division of Chemistry will support the research program of Prof. Geraldine Richmond of the University of Oregon. Prof. Richmond and her research group will employ non-linear optical methods in combination with supporting particle size and zeta potential measurements and molecular dynamic simulations to is to provide molecular level insights into absorptive and reactive processes at the interface of aqueous solutions in contact with oils, gases, and macromolecular systems. The studies focus on: i) understanding the behavior of surfactants, polymers and dispersants at planar and particle interfaces between water and an organic liquid (oil); and ii) understanding the adsorption, solvation and reactivity of gases and small organic molecules on the surface of aqueous solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecular level understanding of the water/oil interface will enable better assessment and prediction of environmental damage due to oil spills like the 2010 Deep Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The study will provide excellent training opportunities to students and postgraduates who seek training in the area of environmental interface chemistry. Prof. Richmond and her students will carry out extensive outreach activities to explain the importance of their research to the general public and continue their on-going activities to broaden participation of women and minorities in science.</AbstractNarration>
