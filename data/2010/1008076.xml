    <AbstractNarration>Turc&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1008076&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops efficient, accurate and rapidly&lt;br/&gt;convergent algorithms for evaluation of the interaction between&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic fields and complex structures. Specifically, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator and his collaborators develop a family of algorithms&lt;br/&gt;that focus mainly on (1) Fast, high-order numerical solutions for&lt;br/&gt;wave-propagation problems in domains that contain geometric&lt;br/&gt;singularities, and (2) Scattering problems from penetrable&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic periodic structures, with a particular emphasis&lt;br/&gt;on resonant problems relevant to the design of photonic crystals&lt;br/&gt;and Negative Index Materials (NIM). The investigator&lt;br/&gt;concentrates on development and implementation of a massively&lt;br/&gt;parallel computational framework based on integral equation&lt;br/&gt;formulations capable of producing fast and high-order solutions&lt;br/&gt;of wave scattering problems of realistic complexity. The&lt;br/&gt;approach consists of the following main elements: (a) High-order&lt;br/&gt;resolution of the singularities of the solutions of the boundary&lt;br/&gt;integral equations in non-smooth domains; (b)&lt;br/&gt;Pseudodifferential-calculus-based design and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;well-conditioned integral equation formulations leading to small&lt;br/&gt;numbers of Krylov-subspace iterations for a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic transmission problems; and (c) Use of equivalent&lt;br/&gt;sources, FFT-based acceleration algorithms, and implementations&lt;br/&gt;that take advantage of the newly available Graphic Processing&lt;br/&gt;Units (GPUs) computational platforms to dramatically enhance&lt;br/&gt;computational times and capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The algorithms that are developed as part of this project&lt;br/&gt;are of fundamental significance to diverse applications such as&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic interference and compatibility (electronic&lt;br/&gt;circuits), dielectric/magnetic coated conductors, and composite&lt;br/&gt;meta-materials (photonic crystals and Negative Index Materials). &lt;br/&gt;The simulation of electromagnetic wave propagation in complex&lt;br/&gt;structures gives rise to a host of significant computational&lt;br/&gt;challenges that result from non-coercive formulations,&lt;br/&gt;oscillatory solutions, geometric singularities, resonances, and&lt;br/&gt;ill-conditioning in the high-frequency regime. The recent&lt;br/&gt;efforts of the investigator and his collaborators resulted in the&lt;br/&gt;development of a highly efficient computational methodology that&lt;br/&gt;resolved several of these difficulties and whose extension&lt;br/&gt;enables the fulfillment of an ambitious plan: to simulate with&lt;br/&gt;high fidelity realistic scattering environments with a high&lt;br/&gt;dynamic range.</AbstractNarration>
