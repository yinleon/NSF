    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by David Hawkinson and Andrew Sykes at the University of South Dakota. The research projects supported in this site are in a wide range of areas of chemistry. Faculty-student teams will be recruited to this site from regional primarily undergraduate universities and Tribal Colleges (Fort Bethold Community College, Nebraska Indian Community College, and Sinte Gleska University). Over three years, the site will support 49 students and faculty in a ten-week per summer program. A sample of the projects that researchers will work on include: (1) the detection of Hg(II) in fish using a selective luminescence sensor; (2) the fabrication and surface functionalization of electrospun nanofibers; (3) the synthesis and study of biomass-based solid acid catalysts for biodiesel production; (4) the isolation, characterization and quantitation of flavonoids from the prairie turnip (Psoralea esculenta); (5) the synthesis and study of polydomain nanostructured materials for solar fuels catalysis and (6) the development of photocatalysts for environmental applications based upon noble metal containing titanium dioxide aerogels. In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities, including workshops providing training in chemical safety and in using the chemical literature. Students will have numerous opportunities to present their results in a variety of settings, including a brief seminar and poster presentation on-site, as well as at regional and national professional society meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training. This REU site aims to provide students without significant research experience a chance to conduct cutting-edge research in the chemical sciences with dedicated faculty mentors at this predominantly undergraduate institution. The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for further study in the chemical sciences, and graduate school, with eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce. A unique feature of this REU site is the involvement of faculty and students from regional colleges and universities, including Tribal Colleges, which lack access to significant research infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
