    <AbstractNarration>Planning Visit Concerning Electric and Electro-mechanical Properties of CNT-polymer Nanocomposites: An Experimental and Multiscale Modeling Approach&lt;br/&gt;Gary D. Seidel, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, OISE - 1019395&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports two planning visits to Mexico by Prof. Seidel and two of his graduate students. These researchers will travel twice to the Centro de Investigacion Cientifica de Yucatan (CICY) in Merida, Mexico. The purpose of the visits is to conduct preliminary experiments and to prepare research proposals for study of composite materials composed of polymers containing single-wall carbon nanotubes (CNT) that provide a sensing capability through their piezoresistivity. Such materials may find use as indicators of deformation and damage in civil structures as well as in automobiles and aircraft. The two planning visits to Merida are scheduled for the summers of 2010 and 2011 to investigate PET-CNT nanocomposite films and vinyl ester-CNT composites. Their Mexican collaborators will similarly travel to Virginia Tech with CONACyT funding to pursue the joint research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning visit aims to advance a collaboration in the study of polymer-CNT nanocomposites, their synthesis and processing, and their ability to serve as sensors of structural deterioration and damage. This is a current topic of interest in the application of nanotechnology and is intellectually both challenging and rewarding. The work should reveal interesting macroscopic electro-mechanical effects and how they depend on the microscale composition and structure. While promoting international research collaboration among the participants, this project will enable the two graduate students from Virginia Tech to establish professional relationships with their Mexican peers. Success in the development of effective and inexpensive materials and devices for monitoring structural health could have significant benefits by preventing catastrophic failures.</AbstractNarration>
