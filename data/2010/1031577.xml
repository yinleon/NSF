    <AbstractNarration>This workshop is intended to overcome current limitations with regard to the documentation, analysis, advocacy and communication concerning mass violence. Traditional sources of information concerning mass violence have been found inadequate by scholars. For example, media reports depend on reporter acess. Instances of political violence go underreported in certain situations. Non-traditional sources such as those from HRDAG have their own limitations. While thorough, they also suffer from the problems of convenience samples. Also, many researchers seem unaware of these traditional sources. At the same time, human rights groups and policy makers seem unaware of theoretical work in this area from which they might benefit. The purpose of this workshop is to bridge this gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With regards to intellectual merit, this workshop will highlight new and exciting sources of data. It will also consider the limits to these new sources of information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With regards to broader impacts, policy makers and non-governmental organizations will be made aware of current theoretical work in these areas. This would, hopefully, result in them using this work in develop their policies.</AbstractNarration>
