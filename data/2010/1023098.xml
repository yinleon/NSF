    <AbstractNarration>This project will utilize both VHF radio and a network of GPS sensor data collected in the southern (Western Australia) hemisphere, in a collaboration between the US, Australia, and India, to improve the understanding of the storm-time response of the mid-latitude ionosphere. The observations will be obtained in a longitude sector which has a large offset between geographical and geomagnetic sectors, thought to be important for storm-enhanced plasma density (SED) plume generation, and which is similar to that in the northern hemisphere where the proposers have conducted such investigations in the past. Specifically, the investigation will focus on the dynamics and evolution of SED structures, including a comparison between SED behavior in the two hemispheres, as well as on associated total electron content (TEC) gradients and generation of scintillation, which will be observed at unprecedented spatiotemporal detail. This project will provide access to data and research opportunities to students as well as support full-time post-doc involvement.</AbstractNarration>
