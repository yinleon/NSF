    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research program is the development of privacy-aware design practices for information networks. The program is based on the recognition that an information network that collects personal information about its users can have both technical and moral implications, creating serious downstream consequences to the individual and to society. This program establishes the moral obligations of systems designers to protect consumers, creates rules and algorithms for technical designs that protect consumers? privacy rights, and develops educational practices for designers, consumers, and policy makers that further the use of these rules and algorithms. By developing a critical understanding of the technical and moral issues implicated in the use of data collection, the program motivates design practices that further the use of technology while supporting individual privacy and autonomy. &lt;br/&gt;The privacy-aware design practices being developed constitute a design methodology that guides the practicing engineer/computer scientist in the creation of mobile computing and communication systems that minimize the collection of data from users and the public at large. Design tools are being produced to facilitate the application of the design practices. These tools include algorithms for anonymous registration, authentication, and roaming. Case studies are being created to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed rules and the supporting tools. These studies include designs for privacy-aware cellular telephone networks and power consumption monitoring networks for demand-response systems.</AbstractNarration>
