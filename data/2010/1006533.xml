    <AbstractNarration>Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental advances of condensed matter physics require a comprehensive understanding of the impact of interactions and disorder on non-interacting electrons in a perfect lattice. One-dimensional (1D) electron systems provide a fertile ground for physicists as interactions and disorder can completely alter their physical behavior. This project will determine the fundamental origin of resistance in single-wall carbon nanotube, an ideal 1D material, and explore the localization phenomena and the consequences of electron-electron interaction in nanotubes of well-defined chiral structure as a function of disorder and interaction strength. The results will have a broad, long-term impact on carbon nanotube technology. Nanotubes are currently being evaluated and developed for a number of transformative applications, including high-speed electronics; transparent, conducting films for solar photovoltaic cells; and conducting supports for battery electrodes. Understanding the impact of phonons and impurities is essential for optimizing carbon nanotube performance in these applications. Beyond training graduate students at UCF and Columbia, this project will support educational outreach activities involving K-12 educators and students, and our respective communities, with emphasis on underrepresented minorities in the New York metropolitan area and the Greater Orlando.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single-wall carbon nanotubes possess extraordinary electronic properties, which are important for both fundamental and applied nanoscale materials science. In addition to providing a fertile ground for exploring unusual physics in one-dimensional systems, nanotubes are currently being evaluated and developed for a number of transformative applications, including high-speed electronics; transparent, conducting films for solar photovoltaic cells; and conducting supports for battery electrodes. This project will study transport properties of carbon nanotubes of well-defined atomic structure while controlling the experimental environment down to atomic scale, eliminating any unwanted experimental variability. Such unprecedented approach enables this collaborative team to systematically investigate the intrinsic transport properties of carbon nanotubes, which remain poorly understood after years of intensive research. As such, the results will have a broad impact on carbon nanotube science and technology. Finally, this project will support training of graduate students at UCF and Columbia, as well as educational outreach activities involving K-12 educators and students, and our respective communities, with emphasis on underrepresented minorities in the New York metropolitan area and the Greater Orlando.</AbstractNarration>
