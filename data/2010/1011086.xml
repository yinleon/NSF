    <AbstractNarration>The Nexus of Energy, Water, and Climate: From Understanding to Action (Café +) project will develop and test two interactive board game concepts focused on energy, water, and climate with youth and adults from four highly diverse communities in New Mexico. The four primary goals of the project are to: (a) develop, play test, and implement two board, card, or other non-electronic games grounded in energy, water, and climate content at four project sites, (b) identify the key characteristics of the games that maximize problem solving while stimulating interest, engagement, and learning, (c) explore the implications of game playing on dialog, learning, and Café+ satisfaction for youth and adult participants, and (d) evaluate the viability of this model for full scale implementation throughout the existing Café Scientifique program, from which this project is based. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory, PNM Resources, Scott Balaban Games Design, the Los Alamos County Utilities Department, and a host of advisors and consultants from a broad range of organizations and institutions will collaborate to develop, test, and implement the Café+ games model. The primary deliverables include: (a) two non-electronic multiage commercial quality games focused on energy, water, and climate content, (b) a comprehensive pilot study examining the impact, effectiveness, and viability of the Café+ model with the target audiences, and (c) formative and summative evaluations of the games implementation model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant outcome of Café+ is that New Mexico youth and adults, from diverse backgrounds, will learn relevant science content through the development and testing of engaging, innovative commercial quality games. Over 250 youth and adults will benefit directly from their participation in the pilot study. They will not only learn important science content while working collaboratively in groups (youth only and youth/adult groups), but they will also participate in an authentic scientific process experience as playtesters. In this role, youth and adults will experience critical science concepts such as trial and error and refinement. Further, the games will be made publicly available and implemented across the entire Café Scientifique program (n=960 youth).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evaluation study will employ a mixed methods approach to examine project implementation, effectiveness, and impacts. Focus groups, observations, and surveys will be employed to assess a number of variables such as (but not limited to): content knowledge and learning, interest, engagement, game features, game play processes, gaming obstacles and challenges, participant interactions, and motivation. Embedded assessment opportunities will also examine participants' decision making abilities, analytical skills, and ability to transfer knowledge gained to real world situations as they navigate through the games. Data collected at the youth-only pilot test sites will be used in a comparative analysis of similar variables tracked at the youth and adult sites. Formative approaches will provide iterative, ongoing opportunities for programmatic and game refinement and adjustments. The formative and summative evaluations will endeavor to document critical data and findings needed to assess the viability of Café+ as a full scale development project, with additional games and project sites across the country. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Café+ project would add to the limited literature base on learning and science engagement of youth within Science Café settings in the 21st century. More critically, this pilot study could contribute to the dearth of current research on the impact of non-electronic game play can have on youth only groups and youth/adult groups working collaboratively to make important scientific decisions within Science Café settings. This comparative data could prove significant for other program models interested in implementing similar youth and adult game based program. Further, the relevance of the content could potentially spark youths' interest not only in pursuing courses and careers in STEM, but it could also motivate youth and adult participants to become more involved in civic engagement activities occurring within and beyond their local communities.</AbstractNarration>
