    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit: This project studies in detail the factors through which mathematics and statistics training influences career options and choices in STEM fields, with emphasis on gender differences. The project includes a detailed analysis of course and instructor related factors that impact women's (and men's) STEM career choices in the theoretical context of social cognitive career theory. These factors include course format, instructor characteristics (gender, minority status, native speaker, research faculty vs. teaching faculty vs. teaching graduate assistants vs. others), and characteristics of the learning environment (instructor availability, test and grading policies and frequencies, homework expectations, assessment types of student progress, instructor and course ratings, support networks including office hours, help rooms, learning communities, and supplemental instruction). Hypotheses regarding gender specific impacts of these factors are tested using two sets of data: The complete mathematical history of students from high school through community college to university major, linked with course and instructor data for all students that have entered Iowa State University since AY 2006, and a survey instrument that measures self-efficacy and mathematical self-confidence before and after basic mathematical and statistical training at Iowa State.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The project team of educators, mathematicians and statisticians will use the findings of this study to explore instructional changes involving those factors that substantially contribute to career changes away from STEM fields, in particular for female students. Many of the factors under consideration are, at least to some extent, results of the instructional planning of academic departments. Changes in planning practices also provide the foundation for collaboration with high schools and community colleges on gender related transition and career guidance issues that would become particularly pressing if significant differences are found between graduates from different high schools or community colleges. Furthermore, collaboration with other universities will address course and instructor related factors that influence women?s attitudes and achievements in introductory mathematics and statistics courses, together with options of implementing changes aimed at closing the STEM gender gap at these institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded with the NSF EPSCoR office.</AbstractNarration>
