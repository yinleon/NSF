    <AbstractNarration>The Association for Computing Machinery requests funding for a series of workshops for high school teachers from who are interested in placing and teaching Exploring Computer Science (ECS) in their schools. ECS is an entry-level, high-school computing course-developed for the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) that introduces students to the foundational, creative, interdisciplinary, and problem-solving nature of computer science. These workshops will expand the professional development opportunities for ECS beyond LAUSD. They will form a model for use in the next few years as ECS and the larger CS 10K Project, begin to scale for national impact. The PI was one of the developers of ECS and the workshops will be organized and run by the Computer Science Teacher's Association (CSTA).</AbstractNarration>
