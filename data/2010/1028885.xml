    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to determine the extent that altitude is the driving force behind the unusual behavior and morphology exhibited by pygmy tarsiers (Tarsius pumilus) in the upper montane forest of Lore Lindu National Park, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Data on pygmy tarsiers are extremely limited since the species was only recently observed in its natural habitat. A pilot study indicated that pygmy tarsiers may exhibit unique traits that are adaptations to high altitude forest. Given that changes in primate morphology and behavior are known to result from variation in resources along elevational clines, this project explores whether pygmy tarsiers are subject to analogous altitudinal effects. The researchers test hypotheses concerning altitudinal differences in foraging, ranging, habitat usage, group composition, communication, body size, and limb proportions. Tarsiers are captured using mist nets and then followed using radio telemetry equipment in order to collect behavioral data. Ecological data are also collected, including altitude, insect and tree abundance, forest composition, temperature, and precipitation. This study is important to understanding how altitude contributes to variation in primate morphology and behavior, which selective forces were involved in Sulawesi tarsier evolution and speciation, and primate body size evolution. Studying how variation in tarsier morphology and behavior relate to ecological change has implications for understanding early primate evolution, especially in terms of body mass patterns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research represents the first long-term field study of a recently rediscovered and endangered primate species that is restricted to the island of Sulawesi. Information on its habitat usage will contribute to formulating a species-specific conservation plan. In addition, this research will support the local economy with the training of local field assistants, a national park guard, and Indonesian faculty and graduate students at a local university.</AbstractNarration>
