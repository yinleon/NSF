    <AbstractNarration>Gravitational waves are tiny ripples in the geometry of spacetime, generated by distant astrophysical objects such as black holes, neutron stars, and supernovas, that promise to provide unique insights into these intriguing and important astrophysical systems. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) completed successful "science runs" in 2005-2007 and 2009-2010, collecting high-sensitivity data together with the GEO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors located in Europe. This award supports a research program to use the data from those science runs to complete innovative multi-messenger searches for gravitational wave events in collaboration with optical and radio astronomers. The data will also be used to test alternative theories of gravity. Finally, preparations will begin for improved real-time multi-messenger searches using the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors when they begin science running in the 2014 to 2015 timeframe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project helps to maximize NSF's investment in LIGO and Advanced LIGO by exploring highly energetic astrophysical events with both gravitational-wave and radio and/or optical emissions. It thus connects the gravitational-wave detection effort with mainstream astronomy, maximizing the scientific potential through coordinated observations. In addition, it will explore the fundamental physics of gravity. In addition to the benefits to physics and astrophysics knowledge, this project will increase the participation of students and underrepresented minorities in scientific research, disseminate the results from this research to the general public, and improve the teaching and learning of science.</AbstractNarration>
