    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;The gaseous phytohormone ethylene has profound effects on plant growth and development. The biosynthesis of this hormone is influenced by many other hormonal, developmental, and environmental signals, and as such acts as an important point of crosstalk in regulating plant growth and development. This project will explore the mechanisms regulating ethylene biosynthesis in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Previous studies have shown that the regulation of the stability of ACC synthase, a key enzyme in the production of ethylene, is the critical factor controlling how much ethylene plants make. The research supported by this award will build on these findings by charactering the half-lives of different ACC synthase proteins from Arabidopsis to determine how rapidly each is turned-over and how pairing different isoforms together affects their turnover. How other hormones interact to regulate the stability of these different ACS proteins will also be studied. This will help understand how these various signaling pathways influence the production of ethylene. A final aim is to examine the role of proteins that were previously identified as interacting with ACC synthase, with a focus on how these proteins may further regulate the function of ACC synthase. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Results from this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis, which may lead to the ability to manipulate the production of this hormone in agricultural settings and hence an improvement in the quality and longevity of various agricultural products. Furthermore, the regulation of protein turnover has emerged as a central mechanism underlying a variety of biological process, and this project will shed light on this fundamental process. These studies will enhance the infrastructure of research and education by providing hands-on training for undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers. The PI has connections with programs aimed at broadening participation in science. In addition, graduate students are also involved in summer science camp activities for 6-8th graders, providing them hands on science experiments related to plants and ethylene.</AbstractNarration>
