    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Eric Fossum of Wright State University will explore the application of meta-activation in nucleophilic aromatic substitution to polycondensation and the preparation of step-growth polymers with novel structures. The approach is to synthesize 1,3-difluoro-substituted aryl monomers with a variety of pendant electron withdrawing groups. The reactivity of these monomers towards nucleophilic aromatic substitution will be studied and promising systems will be translated into polymerization reactions. The resulting polymers would be meta-linked counterparts to several well known classes of polyarylenes. The thermal and mechanical properties of the polymers will be determined. The broader impacts involve training master's and undergraduate students and disseminating results in publications and seminars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will enhance our fundamental understanding about how to synthesize new polymers (plastics) with high thermal stability and beneficial mechanical properties. The results of these studies could have many important long term impacts on applications in which engineering plastics are important, including automotive, packaging, and aerospace industries.</AbstractNarration>
