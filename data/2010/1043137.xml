    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Bacteria prefer to exist as surface biofilms in which the bacteria form organized colonies surrounded by a protective extracellular matrix that makes them very resistant to disinfection. The tenacity of biofilms can affect medical outcomes by infecting the surfaces of implants and medical devices that must be subsequently removed. They also have a profound effect on public health by transmitting waterborne and respiratory diseases through water distribution systems. For example, a recent study has shown that pathogenic strains of mycobacteria, commonly transmitted by contaminated water, are highly enriched in household showerheads and may be linked to a rise in pulmonary infections in the developed world. This study is examining the effect of small amounts of antibacterial nanoparticles on the attachment of mycobacteria to ceramic surfaces prior to the development of mature biofilms and consequent resistance to disinfection. The fundamental information obtained can be used to develop strategies for the design and manufacture of biofilm resistant, ceramic water purification membranes to be used in water treatment plants in the developed world and ceramic point-of-use filters designed for households in the less developed world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: A unique combination of ceramics processing science and microbiology is being used to study the effect of antibacterial silver nanoparticles on the attachment of mycobacteria to ceramic surfaces. A controlled deposition method is used to vary the concentration and spatial distribution of the silver nanoparticles on the ceramic surfaces. Then the surfaces are exposed to flowing water containing different strains of mycobacteria and the effect of the silver nanoparticles on the attachment of the bacteria is observed and quantified using confocal optical microscopy, electron microscopy and image analysis. The information is then used to develop biofilm resistant ceramic surfaces. Additionally, the project participants are mentoring undergraduate students participating in service learning experiences that provide product development and engineering services to non-governmental organizations that make low-cost ceramic water filters in poor communities in the less developed world.</AbstractNarration>
