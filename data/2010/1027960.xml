    <AbstractNarration>Chronological datasets that span large periods of time are the focus&lt;br/&gt;of study in several diverse disciplines: climatology, geology,&lt;br/&gt;biology, history, and anthropology, to name just a few. While these&lt;br/&gt;datasets share strong links to time scales, they exhibit a great&lt;br/&gt;diversity in most other aspects. For example, some datasets are&lt;br/&gt;derived from ice cores, while others arise from archaeological&lt;br/&gt;artifacts, instrumental records, and numerical modeling. In each&lt;br/&gt;discipline, researchers have spent considerable effort to carefully&lt;br/&gt;developing a time scale for each such dataset, and to interpreting the&lt;br/&gt;resulting temporal data, in turn leading to scientific insights. Such&lt;br/&gt;chronological datasets are growing rapidly in both size and diversity,&lt;br/&gt;due to not only increasing activity by scientists worldwide but also&lt;br/&gt;improving technology. The integration and analysis of this large and&lt;br/&gt;diverse collection of datasets promises to yield significant&lt;br/&gt;scientific breakthroughs. However, such integration and analysis&lt;br/&gt;currently requires a very significant human effort, which severely&lt;br/&gt;restricts our ability to realize its potential value. Most of the&lt;br/&gt;analysis techniques developed in the past do not scale up to the size&lt;br/&gt;and diversity of data we must now analyze. The goal of this project is&lt;br/&gt;to break this barrier to scientific breakthroughs by developing&lt;br/&gt;methods to solve the problems arising from the diversity and volume of&lt;br/&gt;data, and to implement, test, and apply these methods in an&lt;br/&gt;interactive workbench.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing the above workbench requires work in multiple&lt;br/&gt;cyberinfrastructure research topics, which by themselves have received&lt;br/&gt;considerable research attention. By their nature, however, these&lt;br/&gt;topics do not admit many universal solutions and there is currently a&lt;br/&gt;large gap separating the generalized results available in the&lt;br/&gt;informatics literature and their realization in operational systems&lt;br/&gt;that are ready for use by domain scientists. Our effort will focus on&lt;br/&gt;bridging this gap by adapting and specializing known methods, and&lt;br/&gt;developing new ones when needed, to the characteristics of the&lt;br/&gt;chronological data of interest. This work is not limited to the task&lt;br/&gt;of implementing cyberinfrastructure for the described domains based on&lt;br/&gt;known methods. Rather, the work requires research effort to map&lt;br/&gt;concepts and techniques from computer science to various scientific&lt;br/&gt;domains, and vice versa, carefully adapting prior results and&lt;br/&gt;developing new ones. This work requires not only expertise on both the&lt;br/&gt;cyberinfrastructure and domain sciences sides of the gap, but also a&lt;br/&gt;close- knit collaboration that can overcome traditional inter-domain&lt;br/&gt;barriers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By enabling effective use of the large and diverse collection of&lt;br/&gt;chronological data, our workbench opens the door to scientific&lt;br/&gt;breakthroughs in multiple disciplines. As just one specific example,&lt;br/&gt;our workbench will improve our understanding of one of the most&lt;br/&gt;important scientific and societal problems: the operation of the&lt;br/&gt;global climate system, past, present, and future. In addition to&lt;br/&gt;enhancing the effectiveness of the scientists specializing in each&lt;br/&gt;discipline, our work will allow researchers from other disciplines,&lt;br/&gt;and people with a more casual interest, to easily access and,&lt;br/&gt;importantly, process and interpret the same data from which key&lt;br/&gt;research results and forecasts emerge. This aspect is particularly&lt;br/&gt;important as it demystifies the related research that may otherwise&lt;br/&gt;appear arbitrary or opinionated. Shared examples will be traceable by&lt;br/&gt;others all the way back to raw data. Our results will be disseminated&lt;br/&gt;not only through the traditional professional channels but also&lt;br/&gt;through outreach to the broader community.</AbstractNarration>
