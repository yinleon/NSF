    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the problem of&lt;br/&gt;a shortage of pure drinkable water by developing a new portable water purification filter coated&lt;br/&gt;with natural polymers. Initially the developed filters will be utilized for use in personal water&lt;br/&gt;purifiers, later expanding the development of the filter for use in municipal water purification&lt;br/&gt;systems. The development of this green technology based water treatment system will result in a&lt;br/&gt;novel water purifier that is inexpensive, fast acting, simple to use, disposable, easily used in&lt;br/&gt;developing countries, and has minimal impact on the environment. Furthermore, there would be&lt;br/&gt;no formation of harmful disinfection by-products.&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are the provision of an inexpensive, all&lt;br/&gt;natural portable water purification system that will provide good safe potable water, particularly&lt;br/&gt;in third world countries. At risk drinking water can contain a variety of pathogens that can&lt;br/&gt;include heavy metals, harmful bacteria, parasitic cysts, cryptosporidium organisms and viruses.&lt;br/&gt;The best methods to date for removing these pathogens are UV irradiation, ozonation, and&lt;br/&gt;boiling/distillation, with each of these water purification techniques requiring energy and support&lt;br/&gt;systems that are not readily available for remote areas and situations. Other more portable water&lt;br/&gt;treatment methods are not as effective, inconvenient, subject to failures that many times cannot&lt;br/&gt;be easily detected, and/or supply poor tasting water. Therefore, there is a great need for the&lt;br/&gt;development of water purifiers that contain natural polymeric coatings that remove and/or kill&lt;br/&gt;diarrheal diseases-causing bacteria and can also remove heavy metals from water. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;all natural water purification system is intended to remove and/or neutralize all of these multiple&lt;br/&gt;water impurity elements. An established water purification company will be a partner in this&lt;br/&gt;project so as to expedite the commercialization of this developed technology into the&lt;br/&gt;marketplace.</AbstractNarration>
