    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2010. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Brandi Coyner is "Landscape genetics of the Neotoma fuscipes species complex: evaluation of landscape variables as pre-isolating mechanisms of hybridization." The host institution for this research is the University of Nevada, Reno and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Marjorie Matocq&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geographic areas where hybridization occurs have long fascinated biologists in the ecological and evolutionary sciences and offer unique opportunities to study speciation. Physical barriers such as rivers and mountain ranges, behavioral differences related to mating season and mate choice, and reduced fitness and survival of hybrid individuals are mechanisms that can prevent hybridization and lead to speciation. Therefore, landscape characteristics have the potential to contribute to and explain patterns of hybridization. Four models have been proposed to explain the maintenance of stable hybrid zones, and each model predicts differences in hybrid versus purebred fitness and the distribution of pure and hybrid individuals across the landscape. Landscape genetics utilizes the power of geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial statistics to test environmentally-based hybrid models. This study uses a landscape genetics approach to evaluate landscape variation as a potential mechanism preventing or encouraging hybridization. Additionally, this study proposes to evaluate the four models explaining the occurrence of stable hybrid zones in the area where dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes) and big-eared woodrats (Neotoma macrotis) hybridize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives of this research include expanding current and learning new laboratory and analysis skills. Broader impacts of this research include mentoring undergraduate and graduate students. Additionally, outreach includes taking the research into high school classrooms through the sponsoring scientist's Molecules On The Road (MOR) program. This program teaches advanced laboratory and analysis techniques to minority, at-risk high school students to equip those students underrepresented in science to pursue scientific degrees.</AbstractNarration>
