    <AbstractNarration>The site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. This REU site is a joint effort between Syracuse University and SUNY Oswego and constitutes a well-structured program for a cohort of 10 students each year. The objective is to train veterans to conduct trauma-related research with fellow veteran participants. The site offers an online version of a research methods course as well as research mentoring by highly qualified and productive faculty members that have a track record of involving undergraduates in their research. In addition to these faculty mentors, several consultants from various military and non-military backgrounds provide a novel combination of perspectives to address multidisciplinary research questions. The program draws on resources including seminar rooms, laboratories, and housing through Syracuse University and SUNY Oswego. With respect to scientific merit, multiple projects involve students and address important research questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Current interests include research designed to gain a better understanding of the chemical, clinical, cognitive, and family factors associated with various trauma outcomes. Being able to better predict the development of PTSD following trauma can support efforts at prevention and treatment of PTSD. Moreover, our society would benefit from a better understanding of PTSD since the lifetime prevalence of PTSD among adult Americans is relatively high, estimated at 6.8%. This REU site broadens the participation of underrepresented groups by recruiting veterans (particularly minorities and women, when possible) as participants. Training veterans to conduct trauma research with veteran participants is novel and important ? it provides an opportunity to train a group that is underrepresented in graduate programs and yet knowledgeable with regard to the relevant variables impacting the experience and recovery from trauma. Monitoring participants will safeguard veterans from any potential adverse consequences of conducting trauma research with other veterans.</AbstractNarration>
