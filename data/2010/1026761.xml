    <AbstractNarration>The University System of Maryland (USM) Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP)&lt;br/&gt;seeks funding to add a fifth cohort of Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Fellows to its current retention&lt;br/&gt;initiatives. The first cohort of BD Fellows matriculated at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County&lt;br/&gt;(UMBC) in the fall of 2005. In fall 2006, the second cohort of fellows enrolled at the University of&lt;br/&gt;Maryland, College Park (UMCP). The third cohort enrolled at UMCP in the fall of 2008 and the fourth&lt;br/&gt;cohort enrolled at UMBC in the fall of 2009. Since the first BD cohort matriculated at UMBC in 2005,&lt;br/&gt;there have been 48 BD Fellows enrolled in STEM graduate programs at UMBC and UMCP. Eleven&lt;br/&gt;students have completed MS degrees and 37 students are still enrolled.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#56256;&amp;#56473; INTELLECTUAL MERIT&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity will provide a cohort of 12 students who have participated in LSAMP Programs, as&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates, the opportunity to receive substantial funding and other critical support to successfully&lt;br/&gt;pursue graduate degrees in diverse STEM fields at one of the nation?s top research universities. The&lt;br/&gt;participants also will have opportunities, early in their academic careers, to conduct cutting-edge research&lt;br/&gt;with top research scientists on the UMCP campus and at national laboratories located in close proximity&lt;br/&gt;to the campus. The following will be required of BD fellows:&lt;br/&gt;? To participate in community meetings and individual advising meetings;&lt;br/&gt;? To apply for the NSF Graduate Student Research Fellowship during the first year;&lt;br/&gt;? To serve as role models to current undergraduate LSAMP students in the process of applying for&lt;br/&gt;graduate school;&lt;br/&gt;? To present research at national or local conferences;&lt;br/&gt;? To participate in the University System of Maryland?s Graduate Research Symposium;&lt;br/&gt;? To attend and present posters at the NSF Joint Annual Meeting (JAM);&lt;br/&gt;? To present research and serve as mentors at the joint LSAMP/LSAMP-BD Research Symposium;&lt;br/&gt;? To participate in various seminars on campus in order to promote professional development and&lt;br/&gt;growth;&lt;br/&gt;? To participate in joint USM BD cohort events such as Summer Success Institute and the Harvest&lt;br/&gt;Dinner.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#56256;&amp;#56473; BROADER IMPACTS&lt;br/&gt;Many LSAMP students are members of groups that traditionally have been underrepresented in STEM&lt;br/&gt;fields. The proposed activity will increase the number of such students in the pipeline to earn doctoral&lt;br/&gt;degrees in these fields. In addition, activities are planned that would provide the participants with&lt;br/&gt;information about a variety of STEM career options, and help to motivate some of them to prepare for&lt;br/&gt;careers in the professoriate.</AbstractNarration>
