    <AbstractNarration>This project renews a Research Experience for Undergraduates site focused on the area of computer security at the new Maryland Cyber Security Center at the University of Maryland. The site plans to offer enhanced research experiences to teams of undergraduate students. The REU students, called Scholars, will be involved in a variety of aspects of the research process including designing and conducting experiments, analyzing data, handling specialized technical equipment, writing research reports and papers for publication, and presenting their research to others. The site plans to select cohorts of undergraduate students to participate in a nine-week summer research program at the host institution. Particular emphasis is placed on recruitment of students from under-represented populations and from community colleges. The project includes mentorship by the experienced computer science faculty members, technical seminars and workshops, team building activities, student presentations, and other professional development opportunities. The research experience results in the students' better understanding of the computer science discipline, enhanced self-confidence and an increased interest in pursuing graduate school or future research opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in strong research basis and the expertise of the faculty. The projects are in major current research areas that are of interest to the community at large and that have clear practical applications. The students participate in a full range of research activities from preparing research literature reviews to production and dissemination of research results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include providing a quality research experience for undergraduate students, particularly students from underrepresented groups and community college students. The participating faculty members are committed to engaging women and under-represented minority students in their research. Thus this project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning. The project will also provide a better technically educated workforce to meet national security and economic priorities.</AbstractNarration>
