    <AbstractNarration>The formation of new species can be promoted by variation in acoustic signals that play an important role in mating behavior and thus can influence interbreeding between populations. The relationship between signals and speciation has been studied extensively in loud, long-range signals, but many species including birds, bats, and insects also produce quiet, short-range signals that are difficult to observe and record. New technology now makes it possible to obtain high quality field recordings of quiet signals through the use of newly developed radiotransmitters containing miniature microphones. Research supported by this proposal will address the function of short- and long-range song in the dark-eyed junco, by employing this new technology along with song playback experiments and laboratory preference tests to assess variation among populations. It is predicted that short-range song will function predominantly in courtship and differ more between populations than long-range song, establishing short-range song a potential contributor to the development of new species. This research will contribute to the mentorship and training of diverse undergraduates through Indiana University and the NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates program at Mountain Lake Biological Station in Pembroke, Virginia. Much of the research will take place in public areas such as national forests and parks, allowing researchers to interact with youth groups and vacationers. This study will also strengthen scientific collaborations between Indiana University and the Universities of Melbourne (Australia), Illinois, Montana, and California at Davis. All recordings generated in this study will be contributed to the Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds (http://macaulaylibrary.org/index.do) to allow access to both the public and future researchers. The results of this project will be disseminated broadly by public lectures promoted by Audubon societies, publications in scholarly journals, and presentations at national and international conferences.</AbstractNarration>
