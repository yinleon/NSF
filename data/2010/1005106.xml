    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site program at the University of Arkansas will focus on applied research in the development of monitoring and detection Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) systems for a variety of multidisciplinary purposes, such as structural and environmental monitoring, radio frequency identification (RFID), telemetrics, smart home, biomedical sensing, etc. This three year REU site program will engage 10 undergraduate students each year in hands-on research in this important research area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this program include the following: 1) introduce WSN concepts and applications to undergraduate students; 2) provide opportunities for collaborative project-based research with hands-on experience in a multidisciplinary atmosphere; 3) attract undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented groups to conduct research in an emerging field; 4) provide students with the opportunities to apply the knowledge learned in the classroom to solve real-world problems; 5) provide a unique opportunity for participants to carryout research projects specifically designed for them in state-of-the-art laboratories; 6) provide opportunities for the REU students to serve as mentors to younger students; 7) foster a strong bond and team spirit among the participants; and 8) motivate the participants to pursue advanced graduate-level degrees in STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site program will culminate with the participants giving a final presentation, demonstrating a working prototype system, and writing a conference paper on their work to be presented at an appropriate conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment efforts will be targeted to participants from underrepresented groups. Students who participate in this REU program will be encouraged and motivated to pursue graduate-level degrees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This REU Site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program."</AbstractNarration>
