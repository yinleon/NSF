    <AbstractNarration>Scholars Award: The Long Arm of Moore's Law:&lt;br/&gt;New Institutions for Microelectronics Research, 1965-2005&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyrus C.M. Mody&lt;br/&gt;Rice University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Moore's Law (the doubling of components in commercial integrated circuits every 24 months) is the metronome of the microelectronics industry, the largest contributor to U.S. GDP. This study extends recent histories of microelectronics by examining Moore's Law's indirect impact on institutions of American science. The study focuses on three such impacts: the emergence of research communities dedicated to radical alternatives to silicon, such as superconducting computing or molecular electronics; the establishment of institutions for the new field of microfabrication; and the adaptation of miniaturization techniques for use by disciplines such as molecular biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This study's intellectual merit lies in tying progress in miniaturization to the wider context of the late/post Cold War. Previous studies of post-1970 microelectronics focus on corporate actors following economic logic. This study traces the involvement of a more diverse set of actors: creative scientists and engineers proposing radical replacements for silicon; Vietnam protestors on campuses such as Stanford; and scientists, grant officers, and universities coping with the tight budgets of the 1970s. This study will yield a clearer picture of how American science and science policy were shaped in the late/post Cold War by a desire to benefit (from) microelectronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; There are two broader impacts of this study. Content-wise, this study gives some ownership of Moore's Law to the public. Technophilic writers often describe Moore's Law as beyond human control, but this study shows that public expectations about how much scientists should interact with the market, other disciplines, and the military formed a background for miniaturization.&lt;br/&gt; Methodologically, this study demonstrates the utility of geographically-dispersed and interdisciplinary collaborations for making history of technology policy-relevant. This award augments collaborative work sponsored by the Center for Nanotechnology in Society at UCSB. Research funded by this award will be published in articles co-authored with faculty and students in business schools and departments of English, sociology, history, and science and technology studies.</AbstractNarration>
