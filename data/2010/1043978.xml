    <AbstractNarration>Ithaka S+R is developing business plans for two NSDL pathways projects - Climate Literacy and Energy Awareness Network (CLEAN) Pathway and Science and Math Informal Learning Educators (SMILE) Pathway. The project is working to ensure that these two pathways have detailed, carefully-researched sustainability plans for their post-grant periods. Notable features of the project are a work plan that involves deep interaction as the plan is developed between the Ithaka S+R group and the two pathway projects, an evaluation plan that builds measureable sustainability goals, and recommendations that are specifically tailored to the needs and situations of the two pathways projects. Plans and practices developed over the course of this project are being shared with all Pathway projects to inform these additional projects' sustainability efforts.</AbstractNarration>
