    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the REU/RET site in Physics at Baylor University. Selected NSF fellows choose from research opportunities in astrophysics, complex (dusty) plasmas, early universe cosmology, elementary particle physics, nuclear physics,space physics, superstring physics or surface physics. In all of these areas, fellows are involved in advanced scientific research with many of their activities being interdisciplinary in nature. Over the course of the program, fellows are encouraged to become self sufficient in their research agenda. Twice-weekly seminars, an end of the summer Undergraduate Research Symposium and specially designed classes in various physics research areas of interest enhance the overall intellectual impact of the program. Collaborative research opportunities after the REU fellow returns to his or her home institution are available as is partial stipend support for returning to Baylor during the academic year. The program also provides three to five RET (Research Experience for Teachers) fellowships. RET fellows are selected from a national applicant pool and reside on-site for approximately eight weeks. All REU and RET fellows give a research (PowerPoint) presentation and produce both a paper and a poster at the end of their ten-week stay. When possible, fellows are also invited to publish their results with their mentors in peer-reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>
