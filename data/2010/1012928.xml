    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program supports Professor Martin Kirk at the University of New Mexico who will use a combined spectroscopic, magnetic, and computational approach to understand the electronic structure of new donor-acceptor (D-A) biradicals and (py)2M(dioxolene-A)2 (dioxolene = semiquinone/catecholate) extended arrays that possess organic mixed-valency. The proposed D-A systems are ground state analogues of charge separated states generated in photoinduced electron transfer processes, and therefore have direct relevance to various magnetic electron transport conduits, including molecular rectifiers and spintronic devices. The overarching focus of this work is the use of D-A biradicals to facilitate strong D-A electronic coupling and ferromagnetic exchange interactions over great distances. The proposal represents a concise research plan directed toward the achievement of broader long-range goals of adding to the molecular electron transport knowledge base. This will occur through the development of a complete electronic structure description of strong electronic coupling in D-B-A biradicals and through understanding the origin of long-range ferromagnetic exchange mediated by delocalized electrons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Dr. Martin Kirk is performing research in an area of enormous interest. Phenomena such as long-range charge and energy transport in organic and metallo-organic systems are relevant to solar-energy conversion, electronics, and information processing. This work will contribute to the design of new multifunctional supramolecular systems that may function as vital components in magnetic, conducting, electroactive, photoactive, and spintronic devices. Broader impacts will involve teaching, training and learning through collaborative interactions with undergraduate programs at New Mexico Tech and San Jose State University. The diverse culture at the University of New Mexico, with approximately 50% underrepresented persons, has allowed Professor Kirk's group to be represented by students of African, African American, Pacific Island, Chinese, European, and Indian heritage. Approximately half of these have been women and some have been supported through NM-AGEP, an NSF program aimed at increasing the number of minority Ph.D.'s in science and technology.</AbstractNarration>
