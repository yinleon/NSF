    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will complete the&lt;br/&gt;development of a rapid biosensor for the detection of fecal contamination in recreational water&lt;br/&gt;(both fresh and marine). Under current EPA guidelines, marine water should be tested for the&lt;br/&gt;presence of enterococci while fresh water can be tested for either enterococci or E. coli, but all&lt;br/&gt;testing is hampered by a 1-2 day delay before results are available. The current project will&lt;br/&gt;permit this testing to be completed in approximately 3 hours, thereby dramatically improving the&lt;br/&gt;safety of U.S. recreational waters. It will also provide the US EPA with a means to satisfy a&lt;br/&gt;court-ordered requirement to reduce the time of current recreational water testing to ?same day?&lt;br/&gt;results.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are that the CARD? technology can also be&lt;br/&gt;used to test water parks and swimming pools for other pathogenic microorganisms. Moreover,&lt;br/&gt;the CARD? technology can be used in other markets such as drinking water safety,&lt;br/&gt;food/beverage testing, therapeutics manufacturing, personal care product testing, and&lt;br/&gt;human/veterinary diagnostics. In addition, since the fully automated, portable system does not&lt;br/&gt;require operator input, individuals of varying skill levels will be able to easily perform&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated molecular assays that would otherwise have required extensive training and&lt;br/&gt;equipment. Therefore, in applications that require rapid turnaround of results, such as production&lt;br/&gt;floor analysis of in-process or finished products requiring bio-burden analysis, the CARD?&lt;br/&gt;technology will provide an economical and easy solution to improving manufacturing&lt;br/&gt;efficiencies.</AbstractNarration>
