    <AbstractNarration>In this RUI project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor David J. R. Brook of San Jos√© State University will investigate the coordination chemistry of verdazyl free radicals; in particular their incorporation into functional, self assembled nano-structures. Verdazyl radicals exhibit some of the highest reported magnetic exchange interactions with coordinated ions and show reversible one electron oxidation and reduction; however, the number of reported verdazyl coordination compounds is still rather low and the nature of the metal-radical interaction is relatively poorly understood. Studies of verdazyl radicals synthesized using recently established methods will investigate phenomena such as magnetic exchange, spin crossover, valence tautomerization. Techniques and insight from these studies will be used to develop polytopic verdazyl ligands capable of self assembly to produce functional nanostructures with novel electronic structure and magnetic properties. In the context of information storage we will particularly aim for multistable systems where the molecule may be reversibly switched between several states by physical or chemical stimuli. We anticipate that the development of a new series of paramagnetic ligands has transformative potential in the area of magnetochemistry and molecular devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students involved in this project will use a broad range of experimental techniques including synthesis, NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, vibrational spectroscopy, UV-vis, electrochemistry, magnetochemistry and X-ray crystallography. The breadth of the research will allow contributions from MS level graduate students, through freshmen and even advanced high school students. Students are expected to present their research at local, regional and national meetings, in addition to participation in preparation of manuscripts for publication. These activities will increase our graduates preparation for further study at the graduate level or participation in an industrial research setting.</AbstractNarration>
