    <AbstractNarration>Reference, the ability to single out objects in the world using&lt;br/&gt;linguistic expressions, is a fundamental part of communication.&lt;br/&gt;Cognitive scientists have showed that people collaborate on reference,&lt;br/&gt;for example by negotiating about how to describe things. This project&lt;br/&gt;lays the groundwork for computer systems that can do the same.&lt;br/&gt;Eventual applications range from talking robots that can communicate&lt;br/&gt;with people in real physical environments, to tutoring and&lt;br/&gt;decision-support systems that can give comprehensible explanations of&lt;br/&gt;specialized concepts. These applications are open domains, in the&lt;br/&gt;sense that one interlocutor, or both, may have no simple descriptor&lt;br/&gt;for an unfamiliar object. So the system has to have flexible&lt;br/&gt;strategies for describing things in words and inference mechanisms&lt;br/&gt;that acknowledge the possibility of a misunderstanding by either&lt;br/&gt;system or user.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project undertakes exploratory work on the communicative&lt;br/&gt;strategies and inference mechanisms required for collaborative&lt;br/&gt;reference in open domains. During the academic year, PI Stone works&lt;br/&gt;with a computer science student to extend a prototype system with&lt;br/&gt;additional methods for collaborating under uncertainty, drawing on the&lt;br/&gt;student's ongoing research in cognitive modeling, planning and&lt;br/&gt;learning. During the summer, Stone works with a three-member&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary team doing corpus analysis, grammar development and&lt;br/&gt;integration to characterize generic strategies for describing shape,&lt;br/&gt;using rough descriptions and part-whole relationships. The results&lt;br/&gt;are an open-source prototype with more general collaborative reference&lt;br/&gt;abilities along with specific hypotheses, informed by publishable&lt;br/&gt;linguistic and conceptual analyses, about how these abilities might&lt;br/&gt;affect the system's success in referring to unfamiliar objects.</AbstractNarration>
