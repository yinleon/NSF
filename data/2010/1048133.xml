    <AbstractNarration>The field of microbiology has been advanced through the use of new technologies. In recent years, PCR and high throughput DNA sequencing have rapidly propelled microbiology away from its historical dependence on cultivability and morphological classification. However, despite the relative ease with which whole genomes are being obtained, high throughput technologies have not significantly improved our ability to cultivate novel microorganisms in the laboratory. It is well known that many microbes function in syntrophy, exchanging metabolites frequently to sustain their own metabolism. This work proposes that significant enhancements can be made to understanding of microbes, member by member, by developing technologies to foster their syntrophic growth while maintaining their spatial segregation. These issues will be addressed by creating microfluidic cell culture systems with porous walls that allow bacteria to communicate chemically while being physically isolated. The proposed systems will be fabricated using a novel implementation of the well established process of electrophoretic deposition (EPD). The fabrication technique developed in this research will have high impact in microbiology, as well as the micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) and microfluidics communities. This development will transform the way cultivation of previously uncultivable bacteria and archaea is approached, and be a watershed for microbiological research. The principal investigators will leverage several existing partnerships to impact the educational environments at MIT and Harvard. Examples include student mentoring through the MIT Summer Research Program (MSRP), incorporating EPD into a laboratory course at MIT, and training of undergraduates in the Girguis laboratory through the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Undergraduate Research Fellowship (HHMIUF) program.</AbstractNarration>
