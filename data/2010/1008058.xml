    <AbstractNarration>Antman&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1008058&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator gives careful mathematical treatments of a&lt;br/&gt;variety of dynamical and steady-state nonlinear problems for&lt;br/&gt;deformable rods, shells, and three-dimensional solid bodies,&lt;br/&gt;possibly in contact with moving fluids, variable temperature&lt;br/&gt;fields, and electromagnetic fields. The bodies are composed of&lt;br/&gt;nonlinearly elastic, plastic, viscoplastic, or&lt;br/&gt;magneto-(visco-)elastic materials. In each case, properly&lt;br/&gt;invariant, geometrically exact theories encompassing general&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear constitutive equations are used. The goals of these&lt;br/&gt;studies are to discover new nonlinear effects and new kinds of&lt;br/&gt;instabilities, determine thresholds in constitutive equations&lt;br/&gt;separating qualitatively different responses, determine general&lt;br/&gt;classes of constitutive equations that are both physically and&lt;br/&gt;mathematically natural, determine how existence, regularity, and&lt;br/&gt;well-posedness depend on material behavior, contribute to the&lt;br/&gt;theory of shocks and dissipative mechanisms in solids, and&lt;br/&gt;develop new methods of nonlinear analysis and of effective&lt;br/&gt;computation for problems of solid mechanics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; For treating the behavior of both new technological&lt;br/&gt;materials and old biological materials, such as living tissue,&lt;br/&gt;traditional theories, based on such simplifying assumptions as&lt;br/&gt;small deformations and linear response, may well fail to capture&lt;br/&gt;important physical phenomena and may, in fact, give misleading&lt;br/&gt;information. E.g., the study of a specific problem for a&lt;br/&gt;traditional theory may indicate that a dangerous instability&lt;br/&gt;occurs in a solid body when an externally applied load or&lt;br/&gt;frequency exceeds a certain threshold. An analysis of the same&lt;br/&gt;problem without the simplifying assumptions may well show that a&lt;br/&gt;large class of materials give rise to instabilities at thresholds&lt;br/&gt;much lower than those predicted by simplified theories. Since&lt;br/&gt;correctly formulated exact nonlinear problems of solid mechanics&lt;br/&gt;seldom can be directly subsumed under available mathematical&lt;br/&gt;theories for treating the governing equations, one purpose of&lt;br/&gt;this project is to develop new mathematical techniques to handle&lt;br/&gt;such problems. These techniques can treat whole ranges of&lt;br/&gt;materials at one time. The results have consequences for&lt;br/&gt;structures under loads (bridges, buildings, biological&lt;br/&gt;structures), for control of "smart" structures, and for&lt;br/&gt;micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMs).</AbstractNarration>
