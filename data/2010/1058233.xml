    <AbstractNarration>The PI requests MRI RAPID funding to acquire a spectrofluorometer to measure the multi-spectral fluorescence properties of subsurface oil and a Volatile Organic Carbon Analyzer to measure VOCs in the subsurface plume during upcoming oceanographic cruises. Both instruments are essential for properly calibrating and ground truthing other fluorescence-based instruments used to research the oil spill. A key benefit of these instruments is the ability to provide rapid and detailed analyses of oil properties and composition on board ship in near real-time. In addition, the PI?s request a dedicated APEX profiler with UV fluorescence, particle backscattering, and oxygen sensors to monitor subsurface plumes autonomously during and after the cruises. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instruments in this request will be deployed in an upcoming RAPID funded research cruise to study the biomass, photosynthetic capacity and population composition of photosynthesizing organisms with regard to the potential effects of the oil spill using the Advanced Laser Fluorometer (ALF). They will detect subsurface plumes of oil using APEX floats and study vertical and horizontal velocities in the water column using LADCPs. The spectrofluorometric and VOC measurements will be essential for rapid, on-site confirmation and calibration of fluorescence-based measurements from the other equipment used on this cruise. The output from these two instruments will also be critical for identifying the source signature of any underwater hydrocarbons found. The APEX float will provide a continuous presence in the Gulf of Mexico following the cruise. The excitation/emission spectra obtained on this cruise will be made available to all the investigators working in the Gulf of Mexico to help them interpret their results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested instruments will aid in investigating some of the most fundamental questions about the oil spill ? with this data the PI?s will try to estimate the location and magnitude of the subsurface plumes, to map the spatial extent of the near surface plume, and to understand the effect of the plume on subsurface oxygen concentrations. In addition, the work will complement and inform other interdisciplinary investigations including high-resolution modeling work currently being carried out in the Gulf.</AbstractNarration>
