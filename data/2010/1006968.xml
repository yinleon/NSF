    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: EPS-1006968 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Idaho EPSCoR RII Program: Inter-Campus and Intra-Campus Connectivity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Idaho &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Idaho's EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Inter-Campus and Intra-Campus Cyber Connectivity project focuses on: 1) broadening participation in cyberinfrastructure, 2) facilitating better data management, 3) connecting a more diverse audience to research and research-based education, and 4) leveraging connections to Idaho's K-12 system. The project will support long-term, sustainable cyber connectivity and broadband access capabilities between and within academic institutions in Idaho by investing in a variety of diverse and unique networking improvements at multiple locations. This project is designed to provide infrastructure to fill gaps in the Idaho Regional Optical Network. Improvements will be implemented at North Idaho College and the University of Idaho Harbor Center in Coeur d'Alene, Lewis-Clark State College, the College of Southern Idaho, and the Center for Advanced Energy Studies in Idaho Falls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The project will facilitate synergy among NSF EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) Track-1 and Track-2 activities related to the theme of "Water Resources in a Changing Climate". Relatively small investments in key areas, plus appropriate leveraging, will result in a more complete networking landscape. The increased access to interactive visualization, databases of environmental observations and modeling results, and data-sharing will lead to a high level of collaboration among institutions and support a wide range of research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The project will promote teaching, training, and learning through investments in cyberinfrastructure. The institutions that will receive funding have a high potential to reach diverse populations of both Native Americans and Hispanics. The project budget includes investments in video-conferencing equipment compatible with existing equipment recently purchased through the RII Track-1 award. The data management plan for Idaho's RII projects will create centralized archives of data related to climate change and water resources in Idaho. These will be a valuable resource for many local, regional, and national constituents, including academic institutions, state and federal agencies, stakeholders, K-12 schools, and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
