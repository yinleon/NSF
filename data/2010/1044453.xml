    <AbstractNarration>To meet the challenges of the genomic era, undergraduate students need to learn how to operate the new sequencing technologies and analyze the resultant data. This project is developing a series of multi-disciplinary courses in ecosystem genomics that teach next generation DNA sequencing technology to undergraduate students, enabling them to analyze the resultant data and interpret the effects of genomic changes on ecosystem health and function. These courses include genomic theory, hands on experience in next generation sequencing technology, statistical analysis of genomes, and bioinformatics. Students work on real research projects where the organisms sequenced are new to science, and their work becomes part of annotating the tree of life. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The sequencing data becomes available to the public through standard channels as new specimens are selected for sequencing each year of the course. The curricular materials and online protocols are available for adaptation and implementation at both two- and four-year institutions. Evaluative activities examine the interdisciplinary learning gains for students and their perceived enthusiasm for science and research.</AbstractNarration>
