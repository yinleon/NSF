    <AbstractNarration>Golovaty&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1009849&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Possible applications of graphene -- a sheet of bonded&lt;br/&gt;carbon atoms -- entail understanding and controlling the coupling&lt;br/&gt;between the mechanical deformation and electronic structure and&lt;br/&gt;transport properties. This coupling is not fully understood, in&lt;br/&gt;part because the basic mechanical response of interacting&lt;br/&gt;graphene sheets is not yet adequately described. Important for&lt;br/&gt;predicting this response are the nonlocal van der Waals forces&lt;br/&gt;between layers of graphene and between graphene and a supporting&lt;br/&gt;substrate. The aim of the project is to develop and investigate&lt;br/&gt;continuum models of graphene structures that incorporate van der&lt;br/&gt;Waals forces in a rigorous way, accounting for long-range&lt;br/&gt;ordering of atoms. Derived via a multiscale analysis, the&lt;br/&gt;continuum models are formulated within nonlinear rod and shell&lt;br/&gt;theories. Equilibrium configurations of various graphene&lt;br/&gt;structures -- involving multiple layers and different substrates&lt;br/&gt;-- under external loads are analyzed using the tools of&lt;br/&gt;bifurcation theory. Also, the thermal properties of nanotube&lt;br/&gt;composites are investigated within the framework of a network&lt;br/&gt;model taking into account the influence of van der Waals forces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Interest in macromolecules composed of carbon atoms has&lt;br/&gt;stimulated a great deal of recent research in materials science&lt;br/&gt;and physics. Much of this work has focused on carbon nanotubes&lt;br/&gt;and, more recently, on the basic structural element of a nanotube&lt;br/&gt;-- graphene. Graphene is a single-atom-thick sheet of bonded&lt;br/&gt;carbon atoms. Despite many decades of effort, only within the&lt;br/&gt;last six years have scientists discovered methods for producing&lt;br/&gt;isolated individual graphene sheets. This discovery has&lt;br/&gt;stimulated a flurry of experimental and theoretical work on the&lt;br/&gt;exceptional mechanical, thermal, and electronic properties of&lt;br/&gt;graphene. Exploiting these properties could lead to significant&lt;br/&gt;advances in many technologies and yield, for example, more&lt;br/&gt;efficient solar cells, faster microprocessors, or lighter,&lt;br/&gt;stronger composite materials. The principal goal of this project&lt;br/&gt;is to employ mathematical modeling to gain a better fundamental&lt;br/&gt;understanding of how atomic-scale forces between layers of a&lt;br/&gt;carbon nanostructure influence its mechanical and thermal&lt;br/&gt;characteristics. The project investigators are developing and&lt;br/&gt;analyzing comprehensive multiscale models of interacting graphene&lt;br/&gt;layers by utilizing ideas at the forefront of existing theories&lt;br/&gt;as well as by introducing new mathematical tools.</AbstractNarration>
