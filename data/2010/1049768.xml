    <AbstractNarration>The development of the brain is a complex process in which neurons migrate and extend over great distances in order to form functional and precise neural circuits. While many important molecular cues that sculpt the shape of neurons and guide their migratory trajectories have been identified, new molecular cues continue to be discovered and characterized. The purpose of this investigation, conducted by Drs. Barbara Lom and Jennifer Round of Davidson College, is to characterize the functional roles of the Slitrks, a novel family of guidance molecules in the developing nervous system. Slitrk proteins are abundant in the brains of mice and humans; previous studies show that Slitrks can influence neuron shape and trajectory, but further research is needed to understand the role of Slitrks in brain development. Drs. Lom and Round will utilize zebrafish, an appropriate and cost effective animal model for understanding nervous system formation in all vertebrates. Using molecular approaches, they will determine where and when Slitrks are expressed in the zebrafish brain. They will also reduce Slitrk protein levels by using reverse genetic approaches and examine the resulting defects in brain wiring. These experiments will allow Drs. Lom and Round to discover and publish important and novel information on the function of Slitrks in vertebrate brain development. Moreover, the study will be performed at Davidson College, a liberal arts college focused exclusively on undergraduate education. Thus, Drs. Lom and Round will expand our basic knowledge of brain development while simultaneously engaging young students in the scientific research process. This research will provide insight into the molecular basis of nervous system development and provide valuable training for the next generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>
