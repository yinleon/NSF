    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focused on real-time automated data mining of medical videos. These videos are of increasing importance, particularly in applications such as real-time decision making based on video recordings of networks of blood vessels. The proposed research addresses the real-time knowledge discovery from large volumes of complex video signals, for the generation of predictive models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successfully deployed, the technology enabled by this effort will extend an area of emerging clinical significance. The effort proposes to specialize a tool towards assessment of tissue oxygenation using real-time automated processing of microcirculation videos. The real-time and fully automated nature of image processing and machine learning methods proposed by this project, places this technology in a strong position in the market, both as a standalone system and as a software package included with imaging hardware.</AbstractNarration>
