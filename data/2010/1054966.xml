    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Compressible turbulent flows, characterized by a wide range of spatial and temporal scales,&lt;br/&gt;occur in many natural (supernovae explosions, volcanic eruptions, solar wind) and engineering&lt;br/&gt;systems (commercial and supersonic flight and propulsion, reacting flows). Due to their complexity,&lt;br/&gt;though, our fundamental understanding remains very limited, especially at high Reynolds numbers,&lt;br/&gt;restricting our ability to predict natural phenomena and design better engineering devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research advances the knowledge of compressible turbulence only possible through massive&lt;br/&gt;simulations enabled by Cyberinfrastructure pushing, in turn, the frontiers of computational fluid&lt;br/&gt;dynamics. The simulations, unprecedented in size and detail, require novel software that efficiently&lt;br/&gt;uses hundreds of thousands of processors at Petascale levels and set the path for simulations at even&lt;br/&gt;larger scales. The emphasis is in extreme parallelism exploring advanced features likely to exist&lt;br/&gt;in future architectures including communication libraries, programming models and accelerators.&lt;br/&gt;The tremendous details unveiled by the simulations provide a unique opportunity for investigators&lt;br/&gt;to understand long-standing issues such as small-scale universality, inertial-range scaling, intermittency and largely unexplored areas such as mixing and dispersion of contaminants. Results are&lt;br/&gt;made available through a portal which allows the community to obtain flow fields, statistics and&lt;br/&gt;codes, and analyze massive datasets remotely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research and education are integrated at the interface between high-performance computing&lt;br/&gt;(HPC) and fluid mechanics. The educational goal is to (i) inspire students, including those from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups, to pursue careers in HPC and fluid mechanics, and (ii) educate future&lt;br/&gt;scientists and engineers capable of deploying Petascale solutions to important societal and technological problems. Educational and research activities are integrated through curricular innovation,&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research and the portal which is also used to disseminate results to a broader audience.</AbstractNarration>
