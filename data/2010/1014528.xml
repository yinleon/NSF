    <AbstractNarration>This is a 3-year proposal focused on providing better images of short-wavelength heterogeneity in the Earth?fs deep mantle by analyzing large quantities of seismicly reflected waves. This research continues the PI?fs postdoctoral work that generated new high-resolution maps of discontinuity topography for the mantle transition zone. The proposal requests 3 years in order to rigorously and thoroughly evaluate a large data volume with abundant, but difficult to analyze low signal-to-noise data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study, the PI proposes to improve upon his previous stacking-inversion method for the mantle transition zone [Lawrence and Shearer, 2008] by 1) improving the imaging technique with non-uniform and multiple grid inversion analyses, and 2) incorporating more data and data types to enhance data coverage. This study will also augment the technique to evaluate topography on a deeper set of interfaces associate with the D?? layer at the core mantle boundary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further analysis of reflected waves in the mantle will determine if a possible discontinuity at ~1100 km depth is robust, and independently confirmed with complementary data sets. If the interface is robust, geographical analysis will determine if the interface is a global or regional observation. Further analysis will also investigate the possibility of other, previously undiscovered horizontal, tilted, and/or semi-vertical discontinuities in the mantle. The verification of a new regional or global discontinuity would have major impacts on fields ranging from mineral physics and seismology to convection modeling and geochemistry.</AbstractNarration>
