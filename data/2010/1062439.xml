    <AbstractNarration>This new REU site will engage undergraduates in research in information retrieval with a focus on diverse data. The world is becoming increasingly digitalized. Digital data appear in diverse forms: textual, multimedia, georeferenced, and structured, for example. Retrieving information from large scale and diverse data poses unprecedented challenges. New paradigms need to be explored and next-generation computer scientists need to be prepared with advances in this field. This REU site provides opportunities for ten undergraduate students each summer to directly participate in research that propels Internet innovation in information retrieval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site emphasizes the participation of a diverse group of students, in particular, women, minorities, and students from community colleges. The research activities are structured using the Affinity Research Group (ARG) model, a cooperative approach for involving students with diverse backgrounds. The key elements of this REU experience are: 1) students are given the opportunities to work on research problems with practical applications; 2) students work in groups in a scholarly community that consists of mentors and practitioners who serve as role models and become part of students' virtual support group; 3) students participate in a series of field trips and workshops to bridge their transition to graduate programs; 4) students are closely mentored on posters and research reports preparation that culminates in a public oral presentation at Texas State at the end of each summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: All proposed projects are based on strong research bases derived from the synergistic research expertise from four faculty members in the Texas State Computer Science Department. Each proposed REU project will advance the state of the art in information retrieval. The tools developed by students will enable the community at large to leverage massive amounts of data on the Web for new knowledge discovery and contribute towards national cyberinfrastructure development. Ten weeks of in-depth summer research will increase retention of computer science students, improve their career perspectives, engage them to participate in the next frontier of Internet revolution, and motivate them to enter graduate computer science programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Because Texas State is ranked 13th among producers of Hispanic baccalaureate graduates in the nation, an REU site at Texas State has the potential to provide this audience with quality research experience. Furthermore, encouraging women and minorities to pursue advanced degrees in computer science will build a pipeline of future role models. The network of communities (faculty, students, computer scientists from industry) developed from this REU site will form a valuable support group for undergraduate students to talk and learn more about research as they prepare to enter graduate studies, and could develop into a collaborating relationship between Texas State and the participating students' institutions.</AbstractNarration>
