    <AbstractNarration>Within-population color polymorphisms provide biologists with eye-catching examples in which to study how variation is maintained. Little is known about polymorphisms caused by pterins, a genetically determined class of pigments. This study examines the pterin-based red/yellow fin polymorphism found in male bluefin killifish Lucania goodei. The L. goodei system is unique in that there are no behavioral types associated with the polymorphism or rare-male advantage via sexual selection. However, in many populations, males with yellow fins are less heavily parasitized than those with red fins. By designing genetic markers for the polymorphism, this study integrates population genetics, laboratory experiments, and gene expression analyses to determine how the red/yellow polymorphism is maintained and to examine more closely the link between immunity and pterin production. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research not only addresses the outstanding question in evolutionary biology of how variation is maintained, but it utilizes a novel pterin-based pigment system to do so. The newly developed RAD tag method is used to develop markers for a non-model species, and the project fosters a cross-university collaboration between evolutionary biologists at the University of Illinois and geneticists at the University of Oregon. The work will enhance undergraduate training by including undergraduate assistants and developing a laboratory activity for an Ichthyology course that is based on this pigment identification research.</AbstractNarration>
