    <AbstractNarration>This project is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. The Department of Biology at Pepperdine University will train 10 students for 11 weeks during the summers of 2011-2016. Research opportunities associated with the program range from cellular to organismal systems, and students will have access to state of the art equipment and computer systems essential for such research. The primary goals of the program are to: 1) provide training in the application of the scientific method; 2) involve students in collaborative and interdisciplinary research; 3) expose students to the overall enterprise of science as it relates to the design and implementation of a research project; 4) develop skills in scientific communication; 5) provide students with training in ethical decision-making as it relates to science; 6) train students in various forms of scientific communication; and 7) foster an appreciation for career opportunities in the life sciences including graduate school. In collaboration with a faculty mentor, each student will be encouraged to design a research project that interfaces with on-going research within the department. This research will involve a mixture of lab and field-based activities and will culminate with a student symposium that includes both oral presentations and a poster session. Student recruitment is primarily web-based but includes direct communication with undergraduate-serving institutions with high enrollment of underrepresented groups. Several factors are considered for student selection, including academic record, letters of reference, student interest in obtaining an advanced career in science, and diversity. Program assessment will be done using the common REU assessment tool as well as specific tools developed internally. Follow-through of the REU program will include student presentations at regional and national meetings, tracking of past students, and student participation in a local Science Camp for middle school students. For more information about the program, students can visit http://seaver.pepperdine.edu/naturalscience/programs/surb/default.htm, or contact the PI (Dr. Jay Brewster at jay.brewster@pepperdine.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Rodney L. Honeycutt at rodney.honeycutt@pepperdine.edu).</AbstractNarration>
