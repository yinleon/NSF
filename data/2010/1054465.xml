    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to quantify the material behavior of liquid crystal polymer networks that change their shape in response to light. This research will provide a new understanding of complex photomechanical behavior and facilitate the future design of adaptive structures with unprecedented characteristics. Recent experiments have demonstrated high performance, light induced shape changes; however, the interactions between the polymer network and liquid crystals are poorly understood. Material models that can correlate polymer network interactions with complex liquid crystal microstructure and light absorption are critical to understand these materials. Predictions of the photoelastomer mechanics will be formulated, simulated, and compared with experiments. Experiments will include quantifying photo-induced molecular evolution using solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and actuator size effects on photomechanical efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creation of new knowledge on the mechanics of liquid crystal polymer networks is expected to have broad implications on developing actuators driven directly by light, including robotic manipulators, microfluidics, energy harvesting, and adaptive optics. In addition, the educational objectives will include research integration into the curriculum by creating a remote Web-based active materials laboratory and course, an active materials Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program, and a K-12 program at the Mary Brogan Museum of Art and Science. The museum program will include a hands-on exhibit of a smart structure wind tunnel model. Under-represented minorities will also be heavily recruited through the joint engineering program between Florida State University and Florida A&amp;M University (a Historical Black College and University).</AbstractNarration>
