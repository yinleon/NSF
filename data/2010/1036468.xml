    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Peggy Cebe is an internationally recognized expert in polymer physics, a Fellow of the American Physical Society and an educator. Over her 22-year career in academia she has mentored 91 undergraduates, nearly all of them from underrepresented groups. Since 2003, Dr. Cebe has instructed and mentored 26 deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) interns who have constructed research leading to co-authorship of scientific publications and presentations at national scientific meetings. To promote science to DHH students at an earlier age, Dr. Cebe, along with a Big Brother/Big Sister DHH intern, visits middle and high schools for the deaf to perform demonstrations and hands-on experiments and to discuss science, technology, engineering and mathematics careers with young students.</AbstractNarration>
