    <AbstractNarration>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;This project is to continue research that will ultimately result in the completion of a biography of Johannes Wislicenus (1835-1902), a major German chemist of the last half of the nineteenth century who directed chemical laboratories in Z端rich (1860-1872), W端rzburg (1872-1885) and Leipzig (1885-1902). The grant will support the PI during a sabbatical leave to write the biography and provide funds for final research visits to libraries and archives in New York City, Kansas City, Germany, and Switzerland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The biography will draw on previously unexamined archival materials, and will discuss Wislicenus' chemistry, primarily his advocacy for the atomic theory and stereochemistry. It will also use his life to explore cultural and institutional themes in nineteenth century German science, including the relationship between science and religion in 1850s Germany, science and mathematics education, professional training in nineteenth century chemistry and the formation of a scientific "personality," the institutional history of chemistry in Halle, Z端rich, W端rzburg and Leipzig, and generational shifts in chemical practice during the later nineteenth century. Many of these themes have not been studied extensively by historians of science. A second, smaller project is the creation of a new undergraduate course on "Lives in Science" at the PI's home institution, Truman State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The biography of Wislicenus will add to the growing number of historically sensitive biographies of scientists written by historians of science. These biographical studies provide a corrective to a common, but incorrect view of science as an impersonal activity. They allow us to see the broader context of how scientists are trained, and provide examples of how science is done in a specific historical and personal context by documenting major intellectual influences and concrete social interactions. Completion of the project will also enhance the number of courses in history of science available to students at Truman State University.</AbstractNarration>
