    <AbstractNarration>Droplet based quantitative analysis of single-cell cytosol in large cell populations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In this project will be created a new single-cell analysis device for detecting compounds inside human red blood cells. The current state of the art for single cell analysis is flow cytometry. Although flow cytometry may quickly analyze the cytosol of many cells, it cannot probe for very many kinds of compounds. In this research, a plastic microfluidic device will be used to lyse the cells, encapsulate the contents of the cell in a droplet with a fluorescent dye and then detect how much of the target molecule was present inside the cell. The plastic microfluidic device will be fabricated and then used for the detection of ion, enzyme, and small compound levels in human red blood cells. The project will support a graduate student and an undergraduate researcher of differing disciplines to promote collaborative learning. The work will allow the students to interact with others at professional conferences and workshops while presenting results. The researchers will also give a short class at a local K-12 school, and will offer a half day tour of the researchers' labs to the students to help promote interest in science and technology.</AbstractNarration>
