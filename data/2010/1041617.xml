    <AbstractNarration>The growing awareness of the acute ecological impacts associated with dams has resulted in increasing public interest in their removal, especially as some estimates indicate that many of the existing 75,000 dams in the U.S. will reach the end of their operational lives within decades. Dam removal represents one important option in ecological amelioration, yet several unanswered questions remain about the specifics of sediment routing, the connectivity between the channel and the floodplain, and the type and magnitude of geomorphic adjustments above and below removed dams. The imminent removal of the Swanzey Dam along the Ashuelot River in southern New Hampshire provides a rare opportunity to test and improve predictive models of sediment flux and channel adjustments and to guide the future development of river restoration science. The removal of the dam is essentially a point release of sediment, discrete in space and time and provides an actual-scale experiment in a natural river. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Francis Magilligan from the Department of Geography at Dartmouth College will use a combination of traditional and innovative laboratory techniques, including aerial lidar analysis and the use of isotopes (Beryllium-7 and Lead-210) as sediment tracers and chronometers, to collect pre- and post-dam removal geomorphic and sedimentological data to quantify changes in biophysical conditions. The data collected in this project will be used to advance quantitative modeling of the length and time scale of channel equilibrium adjustments in the covariant parameters of slope, channel forming flows, grain size, sediment flux, and channel width following dam removal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute basic knowledge on sediment transport and storage, especially the interaction between the channel and floodplain, during river response and recovery from the removal of a disturbance. This geomorphologic information will reveal the ways that streams attain new equilibrium conditions and will further demonstrate the key processes corresponding with these adjustments. In addition to advancing the science fundamental to river restoration, the results of this research will be leveraged by key stakeholders and agencies to advance ongoing regional studies on riverine ecology. Results from this project will further inform managers and scientists and will help guide restoration efforts nationally. With the upcoming removal of numerous dams across the U.S., these results will also provide an important template for predicting the natural processes of channel recovery and will further establish baseline conditions for regional river restoration efforts.</AbstractNarration>
