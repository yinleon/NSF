    <AbstractNarration>Recent advances in sensor technologies and expansion of wired and&lt;br/&gt;wireless communication protocols enable us to continuously collect&lt;br/&gt;information about the physical world, resulting in a rich set of novel&lt;br/&gt;services. The ability to infer relevant patterns from these event&lt;br/&gt;streams in real-time and at various levels of abstractions to make&lt;br/&gt;near instantaneous decisions is crucial for a wide range of mission&lt;br/&gt;critical applications ranging from real-time crisis management to&lt;br/&gt;security. This project designs, implements, and evaluates a novel&lt;br/&gt;complex event processing methodology, henceforth called Complex Event&lt;br/&gt;Analytics (CEA). CEA integrates the capabilities of pattern matching&lt;br/&gt;from complex event processing with the power of multi-level analysis&lt;br/&gt;from static OLAP engines to provide multi-dimensional sequential&lt;br/&gt;pattern analysis over high-speed event streams. The CEA Model&lt;br/&gt;combines CEP and OLAP techniques for efficient multi-dimensional event&lt;br/&gt;pattern analysis at different abstraction levels. Based on&lt;br/&gt;interrelationships in both concept and pattern refinement among&lt;br/&gt;queries, sequence queries are composed into an integrated event&lt;br/&gt;pattern hierarchy. OLAP like operations enable analysts to navigate&lt;br/&gt;from one E-cuboid to another in this event analytics space. CEA&lt;br/&gt;optimization strategies, including rewriting rules, physical&lt;br/&gt;operators, and cost-based search algorithms, achieve scalable event&lt;br/&gt;processing. CEA offers high-performance analytics by maximal shared&lt;br/&gt;processing of event pattern queries. Experimental studies compare the&lt;br/&gt;CEA solution to the state-of-the-art, including traditional stream&lt;br/&gt;query systems and customized event engines. Intellectual merit lies&lt;br/&gt;in the design, development and evaluation of a novel Complex Event&lt;br/&gt;Analytics technology for real-time event stream analysis, -- a perfect&lt;br/&gt;middle ground offering both the sophisticated power of pattern&lt;br/&gt;matching found in modern event processing systems and the capability&lt;br/&gt;of online analytic techniques at multiple levels of abstraction of&lt;br/&gt;OLAP engines. CEA impacts society by facilitating a broad range of&lt;br/&gt;stream-centric applications ranging from monitoring of hygiene&lt;br/&gt;compliance to prevent the spread of infectuous diseases in medical&lt;br/&gt;settings to business intelligence processing, and by integrating&lt;br/&gt;project activities with education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web site at the URL:&lt;br/&gt;http://davis.wpi.edu/dsrg/PROJECTS/CEA</AbstractNarration>
