    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project uses single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) conjugated with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to target the SWNTs to tumor cells. SWNTs convert near-infrared (NIR) light to heat and enable the selective photo-thermal ablation of tumor cells upon irradiation of tissues with NIR. To achieve the goal of targeted photo-thermal ablation of cancer cells, the project proposes (1) development of SWNT-MAb conjugates, (2) evaluation of SWNT-MAb conjugate stability in solution and in a cellular environment, (3) validation of targeting capability of SWNT-MAb conjugates, and (4) demonstration of photo-thermal ablation of targeted tumor cells versus healthy cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are the potential for a more cost effective, potent, and non-invasive elimination of tumor cells from a variety of cancers. Although conventional cancer treatments are effective, they are rarely curative. More recently, targeted therapies such as MAbs have provided greater specificity for tumor cells, but most only slow tumor growth and, as such, are typically prescribed in combination with standard, therapies such as cytotoxic agents and radiation. Furthermore, these relatively new targeted biologic therapies are costly, easily reaching over $30,000 for a course of treatment. Most often, multiple modes of therapy are used to tackle cancer requiring many clinic visits adding great cost of care for the patient. The targeted photo-thermal ablation therapy proposed here has the potential to kill any tumor cell for which targeting agents are available or in development.</AbstractNarration>
