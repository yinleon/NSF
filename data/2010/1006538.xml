    <AbstractNarration>Technical: This project aims for greater understanding of semiconductor surface morphology evolution during low energy ion bombardment. The approach is to investigate the effect of seed atoms on nanostructure growth during ion bombardment to identify elementary mechanisms causing self-assembled nanostructure formation. To elucidate the physical processes active, synchrotron-based x-ray techniques along with wafer-curvature stress measurements, atomic force microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cross section transmission electron microscopy will be used to provide detailed information about the structure and chemical composition of the nanostructured surface. Emphasis will be placed on developing quantitative models to predict the dependence of nanostructure growth morphologies and kinetics on the seeding conditions. &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance in electronics and photonics. An improved understanding of the surface processes active during ion bombardment could impact sputter etching, sputter deposition, ion beam assisted deposition and plasma processing. The seeding approach examined in this project may allow the control of nanostructure semiconductor surfaces in a straightforward, inexpensive manner. The project is interdisciplinary, providing graduate, undergraduate and high school students with advantageous opportunities to do research that bridges basic research and application, and research across traditional fields of materials science, chemistry, physics, and engineering. In addition to experiencing, and contributing to an important topic centered in forefront materials research, they will learn basic skills required in the use of a wide range of materials characterization tools. Students will interact with a growing materials research community at Boston University and the graduate student will also have an excellent opportunity to participate in the multi-disciplinary synchrotron research environment.</AbstractNarration>
