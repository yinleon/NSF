    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to improve the control of multiple&lt;br/&gt;testing error rates. A popular approach to multiple testing is based on&lt;br/&gt;permutation. One motivation for the use of permutation-based&lt;br/&gt;testing is to reduce the conservativeness of the tests while still&lt;br/&gt;controlling error rates. Permutation-based tests are thought to achieve&lt;br/&gt;this by incorporating the multivariate distribution of the multiple test&lt;br/&gt;statistics. However, the hypotheses for which permutation testing is known&lt;br/&gt;to be appropriate are different from those usually considered in multiple&lt;br/&gt;testing. In this project, the investigators precisely describe model&lt;br/&gt;assumptions and conditions for permutation testing to control multiple&lt;br/&gt;testing error rates. In particular, the investigators study precise model&lt;br/&gt;assumptions connecting the marginal distributions of interest in multiple&lt;br/&gt;testing to the joint distributions known to be appropriate for permutation&lt;br/&gt;testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the methods studied in this project can be used in many fields, they&lt;br/&gt;will be particularly applicable to genetic association studies.&lt;br/&gt;Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are conducted to discover&lt;br/&gt;biological pathways and prognostic biomarkers, and to guide treatment.&lt;br/&gt;Some GWAS discoveries have failed to replicate, possibly due to&lt;br/&gt;statistical testing procedures lacking error rate control. In this&lt;br/&gt;project, the investigators study the conditions under which currently used&lt;br/&gt;methods are guaranteed to appropriately control statistical error rates.&lt;br/&gt;Such control will lead to better return on investments in developing drugs&lt;br/&gt;and treatments.</AbstractNarration>
