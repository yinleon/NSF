    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial support for junior physicists to participate in the second International Conference on Technology and Instrumentation in Particle Physics (TIPP), which will take place June 9 - 14, 2011 in Chicago, Illinois. This is a new series of international conferences in the field of particle physics sponsored by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP). It was instituted because of an observed need to develop new transformational technologies for the field of high energy physics and the observed trend of an erosion of knowledge in the area of particle detector technology and instrumentation in general, especially under the younger generations. The conference focuses on all areas of detector development and instrumentation in particle physics and aims to foster and encourage worldwide cooperation and communication in those fields. One day will be set aside for short courses for graduate students and junior post-docs. Attendance by junior members of the community is a priority for this meeting. Requests for financial support will be solicited from young scientists throughout the United States. The local organizing committee will evaluate all requests. Awards will be granted respecting diversity, appropriateness of proposed presentation (oral or poster) and minority status of the applicant.</AbstractNarration>
