    <AbstractNarration>The Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (IHÉS)is an international centre dedicated to fundamental research and located near Paris. This award provides funding to partially offset the costs incurred by IHÉS to finance the stipends and subsistence fees of U.S. researchers spending time at the Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S. scientists have consistently been by far the largest group of IHÉS visitors, well ahead of French or Russian scientists, the next two best represented groups. They are undoubtedly attracted by the fact that IHÉS has long been recognized as one of the best places in the world for fundamental research in mathematics and theoretical physics. The international reputation of the Institute's permanent professors and long-term visitors, the broad range of scientific fields represented at IHÉS, the complete freedom researchers enjoy for pursuing their work and the many opportunities for very rich interactions across disciplines are the key factors of this attraction. IHÉS shares many of these characteristics with the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton; it was in fact modeled on IAS, although it is smaller in size, as it does not host researchers in social sciences and the humanities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will not only facilitate the access of U.S. scientists to a leading research institution offering excellent working conditions. It will also benefit the entire scientific community, as it will provide opportunities for U.S. researchers to work with fellow scientists from across the world. In the last years, the number of countries from which IHÉS visiting scientists originate has always been over 30.</AbstractNarration>
