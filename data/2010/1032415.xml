    <AbstractNarration>1032415&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Howell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Very small (nano- to micrometer scale) geometric features on the surface of certain materials can cause thermal radiation emission or absorption to have pronounced directional and wavelength variations. Such tailored surfaces have been studied and their characteristics predicted and experimentally verified. In the design of important radiating devices, however, it would be useful to first identify the desirable directional and wavelength characteristics needed for a particular application, and subsequently determine the surface texture and device geometry that will provide these characteristics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research comprises an inverse mathematical problem, with well-known mathematical difficulties. These difficulties will be addressed resulting in a design method for indentifying specific micro- and nano-scale surface structures that will provide desired directional and spectral radiative emissive and absorptive properties. Therefore, the fundamental research to be performed is to develop inverse analysis methods that can be applied at the micro-nano scale, and to demonstrate that such methods can be validated through comparison with experiment and applied for practical use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: A robust inverse design method for optimizing radiative properties has important applications including but not limited to improving the efficiency of solar collectors, photovoltaic arrays, lighting and radiant heaters. The research will support a post doctoral student as well as graduate and undergraduate researchers. The results can be incorporated into graduate courses and texts in radiation heat transfer.</AbstractNarration>
