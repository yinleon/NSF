    <AbstractNarration>The Ensuring Success for First Generation and Rural College STEM Students project initiates a scholarship program for STEM students at the University of New Mexico-Valencia Campus (UNM-V), a two-year public college of the University of New Mexico system. Established as a branch in 1981, UNM-V is a regional community college serving mostly first generation college students. The average age of students is over 27 years, with over 65% being women and over 55% being Hispanic. Due to challenges of poverty, some students in UNM-V's service area never start college. Also, because college has not formerly been a family value and many college-aged students are expected to help support their families financially, many in this service area find it a hardship to be enrolled full-time while still others are pulled away by family needs and are unable to complete their course work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNM-V has responded to regional demands by offering Certificates and Associate Degrees in Applied Science (AAS) Degrees in Computer Aided Drafting (CAD), Construction Technology (CT), Information Technology (IT) and Digital Media Arts (DMA). Additionally, UNM-V continues to expand its Associate of Science in General Science Degree and has recently added an Associate of Science in Pre-Engineering. These degrees ready students to transfer to local universities to continue courses toward Bachelor's Degrees and beyond. The new scholarship program provides 30 students each year with the ability to attend college on a full-time basis and realize their dream of completing a Certificate or Associate Degree program in General Science, Pre-Engineering, CAD, CT, IT, or DMA. This is not just personally fulfilling, but also has a significant positive economic impact on the individuals, their families and the community at large as these students fill high wage jobs in high demand science and technology industries throughout central New Mexico. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goals for Ensuring Success for First Generation and Rural College STEM Students are to:&lt;br/&gt; a) Increase the number of students receiving Certificates and Associate Degrees in General Science and Engineering, or Certificates and Associate of Applied Science Degrees in CAD, CT, IT, and DMA by a minimum of 10% per year; &lt;br/&gt; b) Increase the number of students completing Certificates within two years and Associate Degrees within three years by 10% per year through financial and academic support; and&lt;br/&gt; c) Increase the number of students transferring to four-year institutions to pursue Bachelor's Degrees by 10% per year through financial and academic support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support for the scholars includes a first semester class which helps them build a social network with their peers, discover their learning styles, and build habits to ensure college success. The scholars also interact with UNM-V faculty in their areas of study and receive supplemental instruction with peer tutors. Lastly, scholars have opportunities to be mentored by individuals in regional STEM industries and to participate in field trips to local four-year institutions, research conferences and local STEM industry sites.</AbstractNarration>
