    <AbstractNarration>TEHNICAL SSUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By providing the opportunity for participating undergraduate students to display the results of their creative academic activities at the national level, the Symposium, which is specifically dedicated to recognize and celebrate the students' exceptional work, is one of the effective means to motivate these students and stimulate their interest in graduate education. The symposium will give participating students a chance to discuss their research projects and exchange ideas with other students, graduate researchers, faculty and professional scientists. In addition students will practice presentation skills and gain invaluable experience presenting research at a premiere, national level, scientific conference .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium will serve to provide recognition to outstanding undergraduate students in polymer science and engineering, to foster networking and exposure, to introduce opportunities in graduate research and education and help develop the careers of future leaders in both academia and industry. The symposium will also offer an occasion for students and supervising faculty to witness how student projects enhance faculty research and also serve the greater community. Additionally, it will provide motivation for future generations of undergraduate students. Those who are not engaged in these pursuits as yet can learn how their fellow students developed their research interests.</AbstractNarration>
