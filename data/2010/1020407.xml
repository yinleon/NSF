    <AbstractNarration>This research and development project studies the impact of Project-Based Inquiry Science (PBIS) on 8th grade students across several large school districts. The PIs include researchers at SRI International's Center for Technology in Learning and Joseph Krajcik of the University of Michigan, one of the original developers of PBIS. NSF funded the development of PBIS over the past two decades, with major investments made in the design of materials and with associated teacher professional development designed to help teachers understand the content of the unit and how to teach it. PBIS is a comprehensive, 3-year middle school science curriculum that focuses on standards-based science content and that uses project-based inquiry science units to help students learn. Prior small-scale studies of PBIS have shown positive impact on student achievement and motivation, and on teacher use of reform-based instruction. The research questions explored are: &lt;br/&gt;1. Efficacy. What is the impact of PBIS on student learning? To what extent do students in PBIS perform better than non-PBIS students on measures of learning?&lt;br/&gt;2. Enactment and teacher practice. What is the impact of the curriculum on teaching quality? What is the fidelity of classroom implementation? How does the depth and level of implementation relate to student outcomes?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study involves both quantitative and qualitative methods; the use of an experimental design allows estimates of causal impacts when combining professional development with the curriculum materials. This is a randomized control trial to test the efficacy of PBIS in 36 schools total and with 72 teachers (18 schools and 36 teachers per condition), and affecting approximately 8,500 8th grade students. The dependent variables for students include results on state-level science test scores and measures of their ability to explain and design in the context of the curriculum units. Mediational analysis measures the association between contextual factors such as fidelity of implementation and quality of the professional development experience and student learning, allowing a deeper understanding of results. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is critical to the ongoing effort to support standards-based curriculum reform in science. PBIS has enjoyed some success in urban settings with diverse groups of students, including those from historically underrepresented groups in science, and now moves to larger scale. This curriculum is among a small number of science curriculum initiatives that are at a stage in the research and development cycle where implementation efforts are focused on scaling to a broader range of schools and districts. The curriculum units are based on design principles drawn from theory and research on how students learn and are aligned with learning goals found in state and national standards. Project outcomes provide evidence about the effects of a published and available inquiry-based science curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
