    <AbstractNarration>The technology to harvest electricity from wind energy&lt;br/&gt;is now sufficiently advanced to make entire cities powered&lt;br/&gt;by wind a reality. High-quality, short-term forecasts of&lt;br/&gt;wind speed are vital for making this a more reliable energy&lt;br/&gt;source. The investigator proposes to study two topics in&lt;br/&gt;wind power forecasting, develop relevant methodologies and&lt;br/&gt;analyze their corresponding properties and performances both&lt;br/&gt;theoretically and through Monte Carlo simulations studies.&lt;br/&gt;The new methods will be applied to a first-of-a-kind testbed&lt;br/&gt;wind dataset from northeastern US. The first topic concerns&lt;br/&gt;shrinkage and selection of space-time variables in various&lt;br/&gt;models for wind power forecasting. The investigator proposes&lt;br/&gt;to combine techniques such as partial least squares and the&lt;br/&gt;adaptive lasso with space-time correlation information that&lt;br/&gt;naturally arises among the predictor variables in the wind&lt;br/&gt;forecasting models. The second topic concerns realistic&lt;br/&gt;forecast evaluations in the context of wind power forecasting.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator proposes to develop new loss functions that&lt;br/&gt;are economically relevant for wind power and study their&lt;br/&gt;properties and their use in building and evaluating forecasting&lt;br/&gt;models in the wind energy arena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary impact of this project is that the new methods&lt;br/&gt;for wind power forecasting will provide valuable tools to&lt;br/&gt;applied practitioners in wind farming. There is an obvious&lt;br/&gt;need for statisticians to be involved in such important&lt;br/&gt;problems related to renewable and clean energies for the&lt;br/&gt;well-being of our society. In particular, the research &lt;br/&gt;topics address crucial and major challenges for advancing &lt;br/&gt;the use of energy from wind.</AbstractNarration>
