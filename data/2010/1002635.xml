    <AbstractNarration>SES: 1002635&lt;br/&gt;PI: Eliza K. Pavalko&lt;br/&gt;Indiana University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Sibyl Kleiner&lt;br/&gt;Indiana University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses the topic of subjective time pressure, or the feeling that one has too much to do and not enough time in which to do it. Subjective time pressure is a social problem that has grown in the wake of women's influx into the labor market, prompting studies on its causes and consequences and debates on how to address the issue. This project uses a large cross-national dataset to consider the role played by both individual and national characteristics. The project will evaluate (1) the extent of cross-national variation in subjective time pressure, (2) the extent to which individual as well as national-level variation can each account for levels of time pressure, and (3) whether the effects of individual-level factors differ by national-level context. The research will include separate analyses by gender, and will test specific hypotheses generated by role theory, work-family research, and comparative studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: The broader impacts of this project address a social problem that has garnered growing attention. As people change how they spend their time, the need to understand life impacts grows more pressing. Such research bears policy relevance by evaluating direct and moderating effects of national policies and other national characteristics.</AbstractNarration>
