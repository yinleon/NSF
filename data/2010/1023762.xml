    <AbstractNarration>The perception of control (POC), a concept from social psychology, is a feeling or belief that individuals have about how much they can control some aspects of the world. This project examines the theory that an individual's level of perceived control over the political world (e.g., election outcomes and government policy) is a critical factor in determining his or her level of civic engagement and political participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on four primary research goals. First, it provides the research community with an accurate way to measure POC in citizen surveys. Second, it demonstrates that the POC construct is both distinct from and superior to existing measures in the political science literature (e.g., political efficacy). Third, it provides data to test hypotheses derived from the POC theory. Fourth, the project provides the scientific community with the methodology to measure POC in a cost-effective way through the use of computerized psychological testing techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on POC is important, because citizens with high POC are more likely to fulfill the role of the "good citizen." Individuals with higher POC should theoretically pay more attention to politics and seek out opportunities to inform themselves, to work with others to advocate their beliefs in the public sphere, and to be active participants in democracy through acts like voting or writing letters to elected officials. By contrast, individuals who perceive that they have no control over political outcomes are more likely to be alienated, detached, uninterested, and uninvolved. Thus, by providing a better understanding of POC and how we might encourage it in citizens, this project aims to provide a basis for designing curricula, volunteerism projects, and other interventions designed to foster civic engagement and good citizenship practices.</AbstractNarration>
