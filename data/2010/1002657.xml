    <AbstractNarration>SES#: 1002657&lt;br/&gt;PI: Cecilia Ridgeway&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Jamillah Bowman&lt;br/&gt;Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study seeks to clarify the conditions under which exposure to inclusive diversity values promotes productive outcomes such as equitable management decisions, reduced discrimination, and improved cognitive performance. Diversity values are often rooted in different rationales about why it is important for minorities and women to be represented in organizations and decision making (e.g. productivity, legal, moral). These differential rationales may vary in perceived legitimacy, resistance by majority group members, and potential to promote social change. This study uses experimental methods to explore social psychological hypotheses regarding how diversity rationales influence behavior toward minority group members during collaborative decision making tasks. Participants first view a video with messages and imagery that indirectly expose them to one of four diversity rationales. They then collaborate with a small racially heterogeneous group to resolve a number of organizational scenarios. Data are collected through an interactive computer program that records patterns in the decision making process and administers survey questions throughout the task. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The findings will inform a growing debate about the conditions under which expanding diversity creates more inclusive organizational environments and improves intergroup relations. The results can be used by leaders to better evaluate alternative policies, structural features, legal strategies, and training mechanisms that seek to institutionalize the value of diversity.</AbstractNarration>
