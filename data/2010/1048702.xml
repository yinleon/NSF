    <AbstractNarration>1048702&lt;br/&gt;Vaddiraju&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposal uses solid-state thermoelectric modules to convert automobile waste heat directly into clean electricity without contributing additional greenhouse gas emissions. Suitable thermoelectric devices require: 1) high conversion efficiencies, 2) optimized form factor, 3) high stability, and 4) tunability for optimized system design. For widespread use of thermoelectric modules in automobiles, a zT&gt;3 is needed, which is not possible with the current state-of-the-art devices. Recent theoretical predictions indicate that one-dimensional nanostructures (nanowires) are useful for the fabrication of highly efficient thermoelectric modules. Fabrication of thermoelectric devices and modules with zT&gt;3 performance requires answering two overarching questions: Q1) what are the sizes and chemical compositions of inorganic nanowires required for achieving zT&gt;3 performance? Q2) how can these nanowires be integrated on a large-scale into thermoelectric devices and modules? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal?s hypothesis is that thermoelectric devices with zT&gt;3 can be fabricated through an ?out-of-the-box? approach that utilizes organic and inorganic materials in unison, performed through homogeneous ?molecular wiring? of inorganic nanowires either to each other or though heterogeneous ?wiring? to organic semiconductor thin films. These two approaches are expected to solve the elusive problem of large-scale integration of nanomaterials while also providing the necessary flexibility for judicious selection of both the chemical components for high thermoelectric performance. The final goal of demonstrating zT&gt;3 performance in large (&gt; 1inch2) inorganic-organic hybrid TE devices will be realized by: 1) Using well-known chemical vapor deposition techniques, modified to this application, to synthesize both inorganic nanowires and organic thin films, followed by assembling them using ?molecular wiring? into cells of various sizes ranging from a few nm2 to a few cm2. 2) Systematically studying the effect of inorganic nanowire size and organic conducting polymer thin film chemistry and thickness on their individual thermoelectric performance, and also on their performance when used in unison as ?molecular wired? inorganic-organic hybrids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second advantage offered by the proposed ?molecular wired? assemblies is enhanced stability against air and moisture-assisted degradation and also against high temperature degradation. This is owed to the saturation of all dangling bonds in the hybrids, leaving no room for both oxygen/moisture adsorption and reaction. This complete saturation of dangling bonds is also expected to make the hybrids stable at very high temperatures. A large temperature difference, as high as 800oC, is available for electricity generation in automobiles. Hence, systematic investigation of the thermoelectric performance of the hybrids over a wide temperature range of 25-800oC will be performed to evaluate the temperature range over which stable zT&gt;3 performance could be realized in them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, assembling individual TE devices into modules requires a metal that exhibits low resistance to charge transfer when brought into contact with the TE cells. Hence, the last aspect of the proposed study is to determine the type of the metal required for assembling individual TE devices into TE modules without lowering their performance.&lt;br/&gt;Systematic studies of the contact resistance of metal-hybrid junctions will be performed by varying the material of the metal in contact with the hybrids (using transfer length method). The type of the metal required for assembling individual TE devices into modules exhibiting zT&gt;3 performance will be deduced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The educational impact of the proposed work will be the training of high school, undergraduate and graduate students through various avenues. 1) The PI, in collaboration with Mr. Berkan kaya, Assistant Principal at Harmony Science Academy, proposes to train high school students from Harmony Science Academy in Houston, TX and teach them techniques of nanomaterials synthesis and characterization. Small projects aimed at fabrication of energy conversion devices will be designed and the results of their work will be presented at various science fairs and competitions, such as ?International Sustainable World (Engineering, Environment, Energy) (www.isweeep.org). 2) The PI is also a volunteer for the NASA?s Motivating Undergraduates in Science and Technology (http://mustmentor.org) project. Through this avenue, the PI proposes to recruit undergraduate students and train them on the techniques for the fabrication of thermoelectrics and further motivate them to pursue graduate education. 3) Training of graduate students will include development of a new class useful for students across many disciplines. This class tentatively scheduled to be offered in spring 2011 is entitled ?Nanomaterials for Energy Conversion?.</AbstractNarration>
