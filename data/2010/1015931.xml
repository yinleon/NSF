    <AbstractNarration>US-China Workshop on High Performance Computing Application Acceleration&lt;br/&gt;The Arctic Region Supercomputing Center (ARSC) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and Chinese colleagues will organize a US-China workshop on application acceleration for high performance computing (HPC) applications. This workshop, to be held in Beijing in October 2010, will address challenges for achieving efficient application performance on HPC systems. These challenges have grown, mainly due to the prevalence of multicore processors and acceleration hardware such as GPUs and the Cell processor. The common interests of Chinese and American scientists in responding to issues of application acceleration have been confirmed through collaborative workshop planning, and some face-to-face visits, but there are few regular opportunities for scholarly communication between US and China researchers on these topics. The workshop will bring US leaders in acceleration technologies to China for three days of scholarly communication and collaboration, with a specific goal of identifying mutually interesting topics for ongoing collaborative research projects. The workshop will include faculty, students, junior researchers, and senior researchers, with participants from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;Application acceleration in high performance computing is not a solved problem. Some of the same acceleration technologies used in new high performance computing (HPC) systems are found in today?s desktop and notebook computers, including GPUs and multicore processors. However, HPC systems are thousands of times larger, and the programs that run on them need more effective communication among the various components and methods for dividing the computation across the system, and other issues such as dealing with very large output and the potential for individual components to fail need to be addressed. The workshop will bring together experts from the two countries to share their views on the state of the art in application acceleration, with the goal of enhancing scientific discovery and analysis through high performance computing. After the workshop, the US and China participants will pursue joint research projects and scientific collaborations. This workshop is supported by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering with co-funding from the Computing and Communication Foundations Program of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate.</AbstractNarration>
