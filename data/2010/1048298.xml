    <AbstractNarration>The main goal of this project is to define and develop a common cloud computing framework that can be used to stimulate the design and development of the next generation of mobile applications. The project will investigate and identify the common set of new cloud services and components needed to support the growth of next-generation mobile applications. The project will develop a framework that integrates these common services, adapts them to the cloud, and interfaces easily with developers to make it convenient to build next-generation mobile cloud computing applications. This project will further explore what enhancements are needed to existing cloud platforms/infrastructures to accommodate this new mobile cloud computing framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has significant broader impacts. The outcomes of this project will be released as open source to spur the advancement of research and development in next-generation mobile cloud applications and systems. The research results of this project will be incorporated into relevant undergraduate and graduate courses. Undergraduate students will be employed in research through REU supplements and the SMART multicultural program at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and a new computation unit will be created and offered to middle and high school students.</AbstractNarration>
