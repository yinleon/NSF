    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build on previous work to produce a transformative learning resource: a first-of-its-kind simulator that applies an innovative approach and advanced 3D interactive technology to learning the complex interrelationships in immunology. The company has used simulation-based learning technology platform to convey disease state concepts and clinical best practices to physicians for large pharmaceutical companies. This project extends this technology and approach to the study of immunology in higher education. Like many areas of science, immunobiology involves complex systems. The company is using an engineering paradigm to create a model immune system that is compartmentalized into elements that interact, forming a responsive whole. When this system is brought to life through interactivity and 3D visuals, students will experience how the immune system functions instead of reading about it. The company will work with educators and immunologists to build this simulator to fill recognized gaps in understanding this science. This Phase II project will result in a commercial version of the Immunobiology Simulator that will be marketed to colleges, universities, and medical schools with strategic science publishing partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to create an Immunobiology Simulator that facilitates the comprehensive understanding of the immune system through direct experience of the interactions between its essential parts. This systems approach is a forward-thinking one that when combined with technology creates a new way to experience and learn immunology. Understanding the immune system is critical for advancing the battle against infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, cancer, asthma, and many other disorders. Immunology is an essential component in sustaining our nations competitiveness in the life sciences. It is a growing element of biology, bioengineering, nursing, and medical school curricula, with 29 schools already offering a dedicated immunology major. The Immunobiology Simulator will be accessible over the Internet, providing broad distribution. With content oversight by accomplished immunologists and educators, it can also be a trusted remote resource to students at institutions that do not retain faculty members with this expertise. The firms systems approach can also be applied to virtually any complex scientific topic using the same Syandus platform and expertise, allowing them to expand the business and impact other areas in life science education</AbstractNarration>
