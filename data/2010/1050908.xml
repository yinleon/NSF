    <AbstractNarration>Animals can move through the world in remarkably complex and effective ways that are still difficult or impossible to replicate in machines. This is particularly evident in soft animals such as octopus, worms and caterpillars which can change shape as they move. A long-term goal of this research is to understand how boneless animals control their bodies and to apply this knowledge in the design and fabrication of entirely new types of robot. In effect, soft animals are working prototypes for all sorts of new devices. Using a well-established model animal (the caterpillar, Manduca sexta) these experiments will simultaneously collect data on the mechanical performance and neural signals driving behavior. New measuring devices (e.g., flexible electrode arrays, micro-force beams) and computational methods have been developed to carry out these studies. Working with engineers, these data will be used to build mathematical models that control and simulate soft animal movements. One outcome will be the first explanation of how a massively deformable structure can be controlled using a few simple commands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to developing a better understanding of animal movements, these studies will have an impact in the fields of engineering and robotics. One immediate effect will be new cross-disciplinary training opportunities for biology and engineering students. A broader impact will be through the public availability of these results for scientists and engineers to develop their own soft material research tools and applications for future technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One potential outcome is the production of Soft Robots for diagnostic and therapeutic use inside the body or for other applications that need extreme mobility (e.g., search and rescue robots for disaster situations). These new machines could be cheap, safe, and biodegradable alternatives to current devices.</AbstractNarration>
