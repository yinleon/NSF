    <AbstractNarration>The synthesis, release and actions of steroid hormones such as estrogens, progesterone, testosterone, and cortisol are vital for normal daily living. For example, the absence of cortisol production is incompatible with life, and insufficient estrogen production in women leads to hot flashes, osteoporosis and infertility. In addition, steroids promote the growth of some cancers. The purpose of this conference is to bring together world-renowned scientists studying the effects of steroid hormones in the brain and other organ systems (heart, pancreas, gonads, colon, etc.). The overarching goal is to develop broad new concepts about the way in which steroids have immediate impact on individual cells in various organ systems as well as long term effects on growth and development of organ systems. This meeting will not only foster new collaborations among the experts in the field but will also provide a venue for junior scientists of diverse background to interact and collaborate with these expert leaders. Moreover, the FASEB conference will foster the development of novel systems level biological approaches toward understanding the communication networks (via blood, nerves, etc.) involved in steroid actions throughout the body. The cross-talk between this distinguished group of scientists, which include marine biologists that work on simple marine organisms and physicians that treat patients, will allow the development of common research approaches to better understand endocrine systems.</AbstractNarration>
