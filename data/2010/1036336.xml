    <AbstractNarration>Grambling State University established the Center for Mathematical Achievement in Science &amp; Technology (CMAST) with funding from an HBCU-UP implementation grant. This Center had a major focus of increasing STEM student performance by reforming mathematics. The present project will expand upon the successes of CMAST by implementing a set of educational strategies and integrated activities to enhance academic performance and increase the success rate of STEM undergraduates. Introductory science and engineering technology courses will be reformed to support student success. A problem based learning approach will be implemented in these courses. Professional development activities will be provided for STEM faculty to assist in the effective transition to an inquiry guided teaching approach. A Living Learning Community will be established for freshmen STEM Majors. The Learning Community will promote the retention of STEM majors from the freshman to sophomore year. The community will be structured to promote teamwork, strong study skills, increase social awareness, and enhance communication skills. A dual STEM degree/teacher certification program through a partnership with the College of Education will be implemented.&lt;br/&gt;The strategies used in this project should be of great interest to educators who face the challenge of retaining and graduating STEM students. Data collected in this project will advance the knowledge of best practices to address the under-preparedness of many entering students for the rigor of STEM disciplines. This project could be used as a model for STEM departments to address the national shortage of qualified STEM teachers in the secondary school setting.</AbstractNarration>
