    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi-user (CRIF:MU) program, Professor Karin Ruhlandt-Senge and colleague Jon Zubieta from Syracuse University will acquire a single-source single crystal X-ray diffractometer equipped with a low temperature device. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) new reagents, polymerization initiators and superbases, (b) solid-state coordination chemistry of organic/inorganic hybrid materials (c) use of terahertz (far-infrared, &lt;200 wavenumbers) vibrational spectroscopy, (d) studies of inorganic pyrophosphate, (e) single crystal X-ray analysis of semiconductive quantum dot precursor complexes (f) solar cell design that produce photocurrent from low-energy, near-IR photons, as well as (g) molecular mechanisms for the assembly and regulation for the MLLI core complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research and will also be available to local academic institutions for research and teaching purposes, including LeMoyne College, SUNY Onondaga Community College, SUNY Cortland, SUNY Oswego, King's College and Hamilton College.</AbstractNarration>
