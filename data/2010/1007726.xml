    <AbstractNarration>The investigator has two objectives to accomplish in this research&lt;br/&gt;project. The first objective is to develop theory of statistical &lt;br/&gt;inference for a new class of semi-parametric odds ratio models that&lt;br/&gt;include both the generalized linear model and the Cox regression model &lt;br/&gt;as special cases. The second objective is to apply this class of &lt;br/&gt;models to solve a number of theoretical problems that are of &lt;br/&gt;importance in applications. These applications include &lt;br/&gt;(1) addressing issues in parameter identifiability, estimation, &lt;br/&gt;and inference in biased sampling designs in studying the association &lt;br/&gt;of a disease with gene and environment factors, (2) introducing &lt;br/&gt;a new approach for testing goodness of fit of generalized linear &lt;br/&gt;models, and (3) developing a new flexible semi-parametric&lt;br/&gt;procedure for multivariate density estimation and &lt;br/&gt;survival analysis with complex dependence structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Flexible and easily interpretable stochastic models are &lt;br/&gt;very useful in extracting information from data with complex &lt;br/&gt;structures. Such data are often collected in studies exploring &lt;br/&gt;the causes of diseases and other socio-economic problems. &lt;br/&gt;The investigator proposes a new class of models for the &lt;br/&gt;statistical analysis of such data. Results from this &lt;br/&gt;research will have broad applications in a variety of scientific fields. &lt;br/&gt;When applied to epidemiological studies, results from this research &lt;br/&gt;will be able to facilitate the design of more powerful statistical &lt;br/&gt;tests for detecting genetic and environmental causes of disease. &lt;br/&gt;When applied to sociological studies, results from this research &lt;br/&gt;will be able to facilitate the understanding of underlying causes &lt;br/&gt;of complex socio-economic problems so that better solutions to the &lt;br/&gt;problems can be found.</AbstractNarration>
