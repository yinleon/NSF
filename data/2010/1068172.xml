    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for an RUI research project carried out by Professor Dimitra Karabali at the Lehman College campus of the City University of New York (CUNY).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In quantum field theory, there is no such thing as a true vacuum: there are always zero-point fluctuations in which particle/anti-particle pairs are produced and then annihilated. The Casimir effect refers to a phenomenon whereby the dynamics of the vacuum itself produces a measurable effect, namely a force. Thus, studies of the Casimir effect are direct probes of the underlying features of quantum field theory. As part of her research, Professor Karabali will continue her studies of the Casimir effect in a variety of settings and under a variety of physical conditions. She will also continue her work to develop a Hamiltonian approach towards studying non-perturbative phenomena in Yang-Mills theories, such as confinement and the existence of a mass gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Specifically, it will play an important role in fostering an active, scientifically oriented research environment at Lehman College, CUNY, a predominantly undergraduate institution with a large number of minority students, designated as a Hispanic serving institution by the U.S. Department of Education. It will also support collaboration between the high-energy theory research groups at Lehman and at City College, CUNY.</AbstractNarration>
