    <AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is funding Professor Gerard Parkin of Columbia University to investigate main group metal chemistry relevant to the development of future technological applications of these elements. Applications range from their enlistment as catalysts to their use in solid-state devices and further research into the chemistry of these elements will lead to new developments. The intent of this proposal is to obtain fundamental information that will facilitate such advances by using well-defined ligands to control the coordination environment about main group metal centers, such as those of zinc and calcium, and thereby derive a detailed understanding concerned with bonding and reactivity of these elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impact of the proposed research is far reaching, and an important aspect involves training students to be future professionals, be it in an academic or industrial setting. The research activities described in this proposal are not restricted to students from Columbia University, but will also involve undergraduate students from other universities (typically non-PhD granting institutions), as illustrated by students who have participated in the NSF REU Program. In addition, high school children will also participate in this research, e.g. from the Harlem Children Society, as has become customary for the group. In addition, the PI will continue to reach out to New York City public middle schools that are ethnically diverse, as well as bring such students in house to gain exposure to simple experimental chemistry at Columbia.</AbstractNarration>
