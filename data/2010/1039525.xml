    <AbstractNarration>Hunt 1039525&lt;br/&gt;University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are committed to provide partial support for an ESSAS (Ecosystem Studies of Sub-Arctic Seas) Program Open Science Meeting (OSM) to be held 22-26 May 2011 in Seattle, Washington. ESSAS was initiated in 2005, originally as a Regional Program in GLOBEC (Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics) and since the termination of GLOBEC, it is now a Regional Program in IMBER (Integrated Marine Biogeochemical and Ecosystem Research). ESSAS is an international collaborative research program that seeks to improve understanding of how climate change will affect the productivity and sustainability of the goods and services offered by the sub-arctic seas. The scientific approach has emphasized comparative studies, and has included both national programs, often involving field work, and international programs emphasizing the synthesis of existing data and their comparison. The ESSAS program is now in its fifth year and, at this mid-point of its intended lifespan, it is appropriate to assess progress to date and fruitful directions for future work. Additionally, several of the national programs in ESSAS are winding down their field work, and it is appropriate to assess their accomplishments and to showcase their results. The structure of the OSM will include a day for workshops, 5 half-day plenary sessions, and three afternoons with 3 or 4 parallel sessions each day, depending on demand. There will also be a venue for poster displays and an evening reception to encourage interactions among the authors of the posters and other attendees at the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
