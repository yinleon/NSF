    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for a special workshop titled ?Facets of Coding Theory: from Algorithms to Networks? and dedicated to the work of Ralf Koetter. The workshop will take place at the Allerton House, in Monticello, Illinois, from Sunday, September 26, until Tuesday, September 28, 2010, immediately prior to the Forty-Eighth Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing. While Ralf Koetter lost his battle with cancer a year ago February, this workshop is not only to honor his memory, but also to celebrate and explore the tremendous wealth of opportunities in research that his work in communications, information theory, coding theory and signal processing brought to light.</AbstractNarration>
