    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of implementing new slow-wave circuits and electron beam confinement innovations for terahertz frequency backward-wave oscillators. A backward wave oscillator emits high- frequency radio waves, tuned by the applied voltage, at frequencies and powers generally higher than available from semiconductor-based devices. The envisioned devices have a compact format, suitable for portable applications, and have the potential to operate as moderate-power terahertz- frequency sources. New circuits and electron guns will be fabricated and evaluated, resulting in the basis for a Phase II prototype design. Successful results would include milliwatt-scale, tunable sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes helping to further open the ?terahertz gap? for a range of applications. This gap refers to a frequency range where technologies and applications have only been slowly developing and emerging. A terahertz backward-wave oscillator should enable advancements in high-frequency communications; chemical, biological, and environmental sensing and imaging; as well as medical diagnosis and security markets. As such, in addition to the advancement of terahertz science and technology themselves, these devices could help propel developments in a number of burgeoning scientific and industrial activities.</AbstractNarration>
