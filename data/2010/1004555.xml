    <AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) that will provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 students, for the summers of 2010-2012. This award is supported by the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO) and Computer Information Science and Engineering (CISE). The program, titled "Training and Experimentation in Computational Biology (TECBio)," focuses on the simulation and visualization of biological systems at multiple scales. TECBio students can expect a challenging and fulfilling research experience that will prepare them for a successful graduate career. A pool of at least 26 research mentors will provide students with a large array of theoretical and experimental research projects to choose from. Students will also receive classroom training in topics pertinent to the emerging field of computational biology, such as computational structural biology, cell and systems modeling, computational genomics, and bioimage informatics. Additionally, TECBio students will participate in a weekly journal club, attend research and career seminars organized specifically for the program, take part in an Ethics Forum that will instruct them in the responsible conduct of research, present their work at a Pittsburgh-wide annual research symposium, and experience the various social and cultural activities available in Pittsburgh. Students will be admitted to the TECBio REU from diverse majors that include biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, statistics, engineering, and computer science. TECBio students will receive a stipend, housing, and travel allowance to, from, and within Pittsburgh. Students who are rising juniors and seniors, especially from small universities and colleges that do not have ample research opportunities and those from underrepresented groups, will be encouraged to apply. TECBio students will play an active role in enhancing the REU program, and will have several opportunities, including the BIO REU common assessment tool, to give their feedback. The TECBio REU will provide various networking opportunities both among students and between students and faculty to foster interactions.
