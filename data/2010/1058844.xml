    <AbstractNarration>The 2010 Fall Workshop on Computational Geometry will be hosted at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, October 29-30, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this particular workshop is to highlight computational geometry methods and applications in sensor networks and network technologies, in line with the Network Technologies Division of the Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology (CEWIT) at Stony Brook, which is providing partial support for the event. Computational geometry has played a significant role in network technology, particularly in ad-hoc sensor networks, data-driven mobility modeling, wireless mesh networks, network optimization, and transportation and communication systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two-day workshop will take place during the fall semester of 2010 (October 29?30) on the campus of Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY. The proximity to many universities in the Northeast will facilitate student involvement; requested funding is targeted particularly at making the workshop accessible to students, both graduate and undergraduate.</AbstractNarration>
