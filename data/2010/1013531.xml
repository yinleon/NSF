    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a scale-up manufacturing process of nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles. The main challenge is controlling the nanoparticle crystal size while maintaining high levels of nitric oxide storage. In this project, critical process parameters including reactant addition rate, reaction temperature and mixing rate will be studied. The Balanced-Nucleation and Growth (BNG) Model will be utilized to transform process data into predictors of controlled particle size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide large-volume nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles for placement in products aimed at the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. Availability of large-quantity nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles is important to combat the rising number of nosocomial infections. However, the necessary scale-up technology to manufacture nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles is not available. This project is expected to provide the processes to manufacture large quantities of nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles for anti-infective product development.</AbstractNarration>
