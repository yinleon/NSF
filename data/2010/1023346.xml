    <AbstractNarration>This project is motivated by the overarching question: How does spatiotemporal variability in regional and global characteristics of electron precipitation influence the magnetosphere-ionosphere (MI) interaction? The precipitation of electrons from the magnetosphere into the ionosphere alters the electrical properties of the ionosphere. By altering the electrical conductance of the ionosphere as well as the scale height, electron precipitation plays a primary agent in regulating both the electrodynamics of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, but also the gravitational escape of ionospheric ions into space. For these reasons, characteristics of electron precipitation such as its flux distributions and its hemispheric power are recognized as key variables for space weather prediction. Current understanding of the effects of electron precipitation has been derived largely from index-based, non-causal empirical precipitation models and from simple first-principles models embedded in global simulations of the magnetosphere. Neither approach adequately captures the complexity or variability of electron precipitation that occurs during major space weather events such as magnetic storms. This project takes a major step in advancing the state-of-the-art by developing physically realistic electron precipitation models that can be causally regulated by state variables derived from global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the magnetosphere. The principal science objectives are i) to improve the fidelity of the electron precipitation fluxes predicted in numerical simulations of the geospace environment, and ii) to use the simulations to investigate the effects of electron precipitation on the MI interaction. Anticipated innovations include improvements in the specification of direct-entry, diffuse and monoenergetic precipitation and development of new models for secondary and broadband precipitation. The proposed developments will be will be tested and their accuracy calibrated in the context of a standalone version of the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) global simulation model as well as the coupled magnetosphere- ionosphere-thermosphere (CMIT) model, which merges the LFM model and the thermosphere-ionosphere electrodynamics general circulation model (TIEGCM). The LFM model will be used to study precipitation, field-aligned currents, convection, and joule dissipation; the TIEGCM will be used to study the impacts of precipitation on the distribution and dynamics of E- and F-region ionization and the resulting electrical conductivities. &lt;br/&gt;The project integrates research and education by advancing discovery and understanding while promoting the teaching and professional development of a PhD student who will perform the bulk of the research under the mentorship of the principal investigator and his collaborators. The project will enhance the infrastructure for research and education by fostering a partnership between participating scientists at Dartmouth College and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Project results will be disseminated in public forums, in refereed journal publications and in conference presentations. Legacies include innovative precipitation models that can be implemented in any global MHD simulation model of the magnetosphere; benefit to society by advancing our capability to forecast geospace weather; and a deeper scientific understanding of causal relationships between the physical attributes and the impacts of electron precipitation in geospace.</AbstractNarration>
