    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-1007811&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Kasra Rafi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects pursue two major themes. First, we can think of the&lt;br/&gt;action of the mapping class group on Teichmueller space as an analogue&lt;br/&gt;of the action of a lattice on a Lie group. This analogy is the&lt;br/&gt;motivation of some of the proposed problems, namely the rigidity and&lt;br/&gt;the counting problems. The other theme is to understand the relation&lt;br/&gt;between different metrics on Teichmueller space. There are several&lt;br/&gt;distinct metrics of interest on Teichmueller space and many questions&lt;br/&gt;are answered for one metric but not for another. We propose the study&lt;br/&gt;of the behavior of geodesics in the Lipschitz metric on Teichmueller&lt;br/&gt;space, which has the feature that the Lipschitz metric can act as a&lt;br/&gt;bridge between the Teichmueller metric and the Lipschitz metric in&lt;br/&gt;Outer space, the model space for outer automorphisms of a free group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical structures studied in this research program provide&lt;br/&gt;coordinates that determine completely a family of two-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;geometries. The oldest questions and constructions in these directions&lt;br/&gt;are more than 150 years old but remain vital because of their central&lt;br/&gt;role in mathematics and their use in analyzing shape-dependent features&lt;br/&gt;of physical systems, including brain anatomy identified in MRI images.&lt;br/&gt;One of the newer lines of investigation compensates for the longstanding&lt;br/&gt;difficulty of imposing a truly satisfactory geometry or metric on&lt;br/&gt;Teichmueller spaces by considering several geometries simultaneously,&lt;br/&gt;aiming to take advantage of the good features of each. This project&lt;br/&gt;aims to pursue this investigation to improve fundamental mathematical&lt;br/&gt;understanding of these important spaces.</AbstractNarration>
