    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a commercially viable two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectrometer. 2D IR spectroscopy is an emerging research and analytical tool. Over the last 10 years since it was first invented, about 40 academic laboratories have begun using the technique to study problems ranging from electron transfer in solar-cell materials to protein folding. The aim of this proposal is to combine advances in laser technology with advances in mid-IR pulse shaping to construct a 2D IR spectrometer that is robust, automated, and technologically more advanced than currently existing technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be three-fold. First, it will enhance scientific understanding across a wide range of disciplines because of the unique time and structure sensitivity of 2D IR spectroscopy as compared to other techniques. Second, our results will be disseminated at academic and trade conferences, which will impact the broader scientific and industrial communities. Third, the commercial impact of this instrument in this proposal will be substantial. Infrared spectrometers are used routinely in academic and industrial research labs throughout the world. A commercial 2D IR spectrometer would enable higher sensitivities and more accurate analytical measurements than possible with current infrared spectrometers, thereby contributing to advances in pharmaceutical agents, energy storage materials, and many other products.</AbstractNarration>
