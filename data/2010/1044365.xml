    <AbstractNarration>The major goal of the project is to provide chemistry and biochemistry students with the fundamental understanding and practical experience necessary to be successful in their future careers. One effective means for doing this is through introduction of modern chemical instrumentation early and throughout the chemistry and biochemistry curricula. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops laboratory exercises of increasing sophistication that utilize four liquid chromatography systems with varying capabilities. Chromatography is an important enabling instrumental method that is used in various forms across the chemical and biochemical disciplines for a wide variety of applications, including pharmaceutical, food, environmental and biomedical analyses and studies. The exercises begin with illustrative bench top exercises and culminate with hands-on experience. Exercises of increasing sophistication are being implemented in laboratories at all levels of the curriculum, such that students who complete the curriculum have a strong working knowledge of this important technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important aspect of this project is the implementation of liquid chromatography exercises in large-enrollment laboratory courses like those taught at most intermediate or large universities. This is accomplished through early instruction using illustrative bench top exercises and through application of multiple state-of-the-art yet affordable separations instruments that allow fast separations. The project is also introducing the technology to local high school science teachers through workshops. In addition, high school students that utilize the instrumentation are being supported to attend local and regional science fairs.</AbstractNarration>
