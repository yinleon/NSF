    <AbstractNarration>Amarillo College is producing technicians with the cutting-edge expertise necessary to meet the needs of alternative-energy industries locally and nationwide through integration of the new AAS degree in Solar Energy Technology into its Renewable Energy degree program. Through strong partnerships with current and potential solar industries and labs in the region, Amarillo College, in conjunction with regional secondary and post-secondary institutions, is taking advantage of its strategic location in the Texas Panhandle. This region is located in both the sun and wind corridors of the nation and enjoys an average of 270 days of sunshine each year (16th in the nation), while being noted as the third windiest area nationally. The Solar Energy Technology program focuses on the development of skills necessary for installation, maintenance, and manufacturing of solar energy technology. Through its efforts, Amarillo College is developing a well-trained alternative-energy workforce for which there is a growing demand both regionally and nationwide, while serving as a model for other two-year colleges poised to help meet the burgeoning workforce needs in the emerging industry of solar energy resources.</AbstractNarration>
