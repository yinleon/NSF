    <AbstractNarration>One of the oldest problems in linguistics is to reconstruct ancient protolanguages on the basis of their modern descendants. Identifying ancestral word forms makes it possible to evaluate proposals about the nature of language change and to draw inferences about human prehistory. Currently, linguists painstakingly reconstruct protolanguages by hand, using knowledge of the relationships between languages and the plausibility of sound changes. This research project develops statistical, computational methods that automate or augment the reconstruction process. Unlike past computational approaches, these new models use detailed phonological representations to infer hidden sound changes. Moreover, they automatically infer which words are co-descendent (cognates). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These advances, combined with new algorithms for large-scale statistical inference, enable the analysis of orders of magnitude more data than prior work. The models from this project significantly expand the computational tools available to linguists; large-scale reconstructions make it possible to collect quantitative data to help answer long-standing questions about language change. Beyond word reconstruction, the models and tools from this project will be useful for other related applications, such as machine translation, where reconstructions can be used to fill gaps in the mapping between the vocabularies of different languages, and the alignment of biological sequences, which requires considering which regions in those sequences are co-descendent. In addition, the technical advances in probabilistic modeling and approximate inference methods will have cross-cutting implications for a range of modeling problems in computational linguistics, bioinformatics, statistics, machine learning, and cognitive science.</AbstractNarration>
