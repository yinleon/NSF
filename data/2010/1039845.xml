    <AbstractNarration>With this award, co-funded by the Division of Chemistry and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, Professor Richard Holz from Loyola University of Chicago will acquire an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer equipped with low temperature liquid helium capabilities and an X band cavity operational in both perpendicular and parallel modes. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as investigations of metallohydrolases and metallohydratases, biologically relevant metal centers, catalytic role of the dinuclear metal binding site in ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase, electronic and catalytic properties of the dinuclear active site of Aminopeptidase P, Mn(II) and divalent VO metal substituted derivatives of alpha subunits of guanine nucleotide binding proteins and copper, zinc superoxide dismutase and applications of X band EPR at low temperatures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid state materials. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation of pathological tumor growth. These studies will impact a number of areas, from the synthesis of inorganic and organic molecules to the development of new solid state materials to compounds of biological interest. Employing examples inspired from ongoing research, this instrument will be an integral part of research and teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels.</AbstractNarration>
