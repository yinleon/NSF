    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical and computational methods for understanding quantum nanosystems are developed based on a methodology that takes advantage of the separation of scales between the average nearest-neighbor distance and the overall system size. The deductive methodology starts with the N-fermion wave equation and results in coarse-grained equations for nanometer-nanosecond scale excitations. The coarse-grained wave equations yield the quantum dynamics of order parameters describing nanoscale features. Several types of order parameters (e.g., scaled particle positions, overall system deformation, and spin/number density profiles) are considered. The theory is based on a hypothesis that the wave function has multiple dependencies on the N-particle configuration, directly and indirectly via a set of order parameters. The result is a rigorous algorithm for simulating the long space-time scale dynamics of quantum nanosystems. Examples of applications are quantum dots, graphene flakes and nanoribbons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has impact on the theory of the quantum behavior of macromolecular assemblies, quantum dots, graphene-like structures, and other quantum nanosystems. Theory, algorithms, and software resulting from this project have impact on the computer-aided design of nanoscale quantum devices, the designing of superconducting nanostructures and other anomalous circuit elements. Collaboration with Prairie View A &amp; M University engages underrepresented groups, both students and faculty, in the two institutions via several educational activities spanning the academic year and the summer. This EAGER project is supported by a joint award including two programs in the Chemistry Division (Theory, Models and Computational Methods and Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry) and the &lt;br/&gt;Division of Mathematical Sciences (Applied Mathematics program).</AbstractNarration>
