    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to support a symposium on Hierarchical Self Assembly of Functional Materials from Nanoscopic-to-Mesoscopic-Length Scales; at the 2010 MRS Spring Meeting; San Francisco, California; April 5-9, 2010. The main theme of this symposium is related with hierarchical self-assembly which is critical to nanomanufacturing of functional nanostructures. There will be sessions focused on DNA self-assembly which enables the construction of sub-50 nm structures in 2D and 3D. Another focus is on as integrating self-assembling nanostructures at a multitude of length scales so that they can be utilized in the real world as well as understanding factors that control reliability and defect tolerance in self-assembly of nanostructures. The world's leading researchers will be invited to speak. This is not only a good opportunity to boost the progress of self-assembly as an emerging nanomanufacturing paradigm, but also a great educational opportunity to participating students, i.e. our future generation of working force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium provides a great opportunity for scientists and engineers from around the world, and from many different disciplines to share their results and insights in the field of self-assembly with a special emphasis on manufacturability of functional nanostructures and materials. As compared to other symposia on self-assembly, this one will focus on key challenges such as three dimensional nanomanufacturing, integration of nanostructures and materials across length scales and yield / defect tolerance. Efforts will be made to publicize student support and hence allow the student attendees to become familiar with state-of-the-art self-assembly methods and understand their requirements and needs. Research groups will be encouraged to support undergraduate participation in the poster sessions, as a means of exposing students to a high level of research at an early age.</AbstractNarration>
