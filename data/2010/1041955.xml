    <AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry supports Timothy Anglin of the University of Minnesota as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. Anglin will work with Prof. Aaron Massari to measure the molecular ordering of semiconductor polymers at the polymer dielectric interface in model organic field effect transistor (OFET) systems. The measurements will be carried out using vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG) a technique that is exquisitely sensitive to material interfaces and insensitive to the bulk. In addition, Dr. Anglin will collaborate with scientists at Argonne National Laboratory to probe longer-scale structure in the same materials using x-ray scattering techniques. For his plan for broadening participation, the PI will organize a career education fair and develop informational materials for local high school/community college students or in the initial stages of their undergraduate careers to illustrate careers that are possible with degrees in chemistry. The fair will be carried out in partnership with groups on the U. Minnesota Campus (Lando, REU and MSROP summer programs) as well as local community colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that of Dr. Anglin is aimed ultimately at developing improved materials for electronic devices. Robust, easily processible polymer electronics could yield substantial savings in the costs of fabrication of a myriad of technologically important devices. The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Anglin are aimed at encouraging young people, especially those from groups underrepresented in the sciences, to pursue higher education in chemistry, by providing a roadmap to an attractive career as a productive member of the American technological workforce.</AbstractNarration>
