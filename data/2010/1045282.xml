    <AbstractNarration>Sequestration of supercritical carbon dioxide in deep subsurface formations through stable trapping and mineralization has received considerable attention in recent years. Once in place, potential exists for the separate phase supercritical liquid or water with dissolved carbon dioxide to leak through the capping layer to shallower formations with potential for serious environmental consequences. Comprehensive fundamental understanding of trapping and leakage processes is required to estimate subsurface carbon dioxide storage capacity and to assess ecological and other environmental risks from leakage. Given the complexity of the problem, developing a comprehensive process-based understanding, through developing modeling tools to design field applications, is only possible by analyzing the problem at multiple scales. This project will complete a set of innovative laboratory sand tank experiments at scales ranging from small (cms) to intermediate (meters) that explore the fundamental processes. The proposed research will use surrogate fluids and innovative testing and measuring methods to complete experiments applicable to deep formation conditions, including high pressures, under ambient laboratory conditions. Existing numerically based models that simulate the mechanisms of multiphase fluid flow, including entrapment, mass transfer, density driven mixing, and bubble migration, will be tested to evaluate their ability to capture the fundamental processes observed in the laboratory. Improvements to these models will be made using the new knowledge generated in this research. Methods to up-scale processes that are characterized in the laboratory systems will be developed and tested. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is of direct relevance to climate change because it will lead to improvements in carbon dioxide sequestration approaches intended to mitigate increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Although some aspects of carbon dioxide sequestration have been extensively studied, the fundamental mechanisms that control stable storage and leakage potential have not received adequate attention. Improvement of our fundamental understanding of these mechanisms through incorporating them into models will facilitate improved site selection and efficient design. Minimizing the risk of leakage will be beneficial to groundwater quality, ecosystems, and the environment. The unique laboratory data sets will be shared with investigators involved in carbon dioxide sequestration research, as well as in other multiphase phase flow problems in hydrology and environmental engineering. Significant educational impacts will be achieved by training students through participation in this research on processes critical to climate change mitigation.</AbstractNarration>
