    <AbstractNarration>Significant numbers of students nationwide place into developmental math when enrolling in a community college. To counter this trend, the project develops contextualized lessons in math with the aim of enhancing student math skills. This project will test whether increased content relevance boosts course retention and academic progress. Based on work at several institutions, the project seeks to improve pedagogical approaches, course design, female and minority student participation, and course articulation at this college and with the region's fourteen local high schools. The work will focus on applied math in five career technical areas (CTE) to 1) develop a one-term community college and a year-long high school math course with contextualized algebra and geometry concepts; 2) conduct an in-depth summer math institute based on the curriculum for regional high school, community college, and industry teaching professionals; 3) integrate the math course into all CTE college curricula; and 4) use the course for dual credit that satisfies State of Oregon diploma requirements as a third-year high school math course.</AbstractNarration>
