    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this program is to provide undergraduate students with an in-depth, hands-on research experience focused on the biological basis of behavior. Students will be trained students in the application of the scientific method to develop hypotheses, design and conduct research studies involving either animal or human subjects. Students are also trained in the responsible conduct of research. Students are mentored by full-time, Ph.D.-level faculty members who are tenured/tenure-track faculty with strong programs of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research conducted by students with their mentors advance understanding of the biological basis of behavior in animals and humans. With regular and frequent contact with mentors, students learn all aspects of the research process, including hypothesis formulation,integration and analysis of scientific literature, research design, data collection, data analysis, and the presentation of research findings. Students also attend seminars focused on statistics, research methods, and preparing for the graduate school application process. To maximize exposure to multiple areas of research, they attend seminars in which faculty mentors present data from recent research. Students also attend a weekly seminar in the responsible conduct of research in which they learn about the history of research ethics, contemporary ethical regulations, as well as data management and authorship practices. Students also discuss case scenarios in which ethical dilemmas are presented. During the 8 weeks, students are housed together in a University dormitory and complete a team-building activity at the start of the program. The REU experience culminates with a one-day public symposium in which students present their work in a poster and in a brief oral presentation. Students and mentors also present research results at regional and/or national conferences and submit research reports for publication in peer-reviewed academic journals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By increasing students' understanding of the biological basis of behavior, the PIs anticipate stimulating interest in careers in science and behavioral research. It has been found that a large percentage of the former REU students have gone on to pursue graduate degrees. Because these REU student cohorts include a high percentage of students from underrepresented groups, the PIs anticipate that this REU Site program is serving to increase the diversity among individuals working in scientific research careers.</AbstractNarration>
