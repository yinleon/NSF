    <AbstractNarration>In this project, the state-of-the art Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) hygrometer, developed through earlier NSF support, will be deployed aboard the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft to make highly accurate and precise measurements of water vapor during the Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field campaign. Due to its large horizontal and vertical range, the GV aircraft can efficiently sample the extratropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The DC3 field campaign will include extensive sampling in environments such deep convection, anvil cirrus, and non-convective cirrus. In addition, a wide variety of chemical and microphysical environments will be sampled including clean and polluted source regions. The VCSEL hygrometer will provide fast measurements of water vapor at sub-cloud scales. This will allow for studies of ice supersaturation both inside and outside of cirrus clouds at unprecedented levels of detail. The environmental conditions surrounding ice supersaturated regions will also be explored on a cloud to synoptic scale. Additionally, this project will include continued efforts to improve methods of water vapor calibrations at conditions representative of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will provide opportunities to involve high school students in order to attract them into science and engineering careers. This will be done in partnership with the non-profit Young Science Achievers Program (YSAP), an organization that funds year-long science projects from underrepresented student-teacher groups in NJ/NYC and pairs each group with a professional mentor. The investigator, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will act as mentors and participate in an annual "Science Day" at Princeton University, laboratory tours, and the preparation of instructional material for teachers.</AbstractNarration>
