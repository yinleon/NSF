    <AbstractNarration>Mark Tuckerman of New York University is supported by an award from the Theory Models and Computational Method program of the Chemistry Division to carry out research, development, and application of novel methods for enhanced conformational sampling, free energy prediction, and hybrid QM/MM calculations. The aim of this project is to address directly measurable structural and dynamical quantities of complex chemical processes in the condensed phase in novel ways based on modeling and simulation. To that end, a novel approach to conformational sampling based on the introduction of specialized variable transformations in the classical canonical partition function is being developed. This approach reduces the effect of energy barriers without altering thermodynamic and equilibrium properties of the system. Applications include systems with increasing complexity, from peptides to fast-folding proteins. &lt;br/&gt;Hence, there are potential benefits to fields ranging from human health (simulations of protein folding and miss-folding) to the rational design of novel materials. A second component of the project addresses chemical reactivity in large biomolecules such as enzymes via the quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) method. A rigorous theory of molecular pseudo-potentials is developed for describing the interaction between the QM and MM subsystems. The new pseudo-potentials are to be gathered in a database made available to the community on the awardee's Web site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methodology development and its incorporation into user-friendly open-source software that is freely available to the community are components of the project that strongly impact computational chemistry and biology, leading to new approaches for solving complex problems in silico. Tuckerman's undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers are a diverse and gender-balanced group. Notes of the graduate Statistical Mechanics course, currently available through the Web, are supplemented with advances in this project. Outreach seminars at the Mathematics Speakers Bureau (MSB) of the New York section of the Mathematical Association of America enrich the background of students and faculty of regional middle schools, high schools, colleges and universities on topics reaching beyond the traditional math curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
