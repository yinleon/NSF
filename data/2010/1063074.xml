    <AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the University of Arkansas (UA) that will provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 students, during the summers of 2011- 2013. This REU program focuses on applied biotechnology in the life sciences -- the application of modern molecular technologies to basic and applied research in engineering, biochemistry, biology, and plant or animal agriculture. Training and mentoring is provided by outstanding faculty with diverse research projects within the Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Cell and Molecular Biology (http://cemb.uark.edu). Students are expected to engage in full-time lab research supplemented with twice-weekly workshops on topics such as preparation and application for graduate school, responsible conduct of research, professional communication and networking, and career opportunities. REU students will also network with students in other programs on campus. Student recruitment will include campus visits and emails to targeted colleges, and posting of program information at the REU program website. Student selection will be based on academic performance, letters of reference, student resume, and the applicants' statement of research interests and experiences. The program will be assessed using pre- and post-experience surveys of participating students and faculty, tracking of student participants, and an REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting the REU program website (http://cemb.uark.edu/REU), or by contacting the PI (Dr. Douglas Rhoads, drhoads@uark.edu) or the Director (Shani Farr, sfarr@uark.edu).</AbstractNarration>
