    <AbstractNarration>The workshop, "Partial Differential Equation Models of Biological Processes", is being held at the National Center for Theoretical Sciences at Taiwan, December 13-17, 2010. The focus of the workshop is on modeling and analysis of partial differential equation models from Cell Biology, Physiology and Population Dynamics. The last ten years witnessed tremendous growth in the area of mathematical biology, and emerging questions from biology and medicine have brought new and exciting mathematical questions. Cell Biology, Physiology and Population Dynamics are three of the areas where partial differential equation modeling and analysis can play a crucial role. A major goal of the workshop is to facilitate the initiation of collaborative research projects between mathematical biologists and traditional hard-core analysts in partial differential equations as these two groups typically attend specialized conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By hosting this workshop, communication will be encouraged and facilitated between researchers not only in different mathematical fields, but also across international borders. The workshop provides an opportunity for developing new contacts and for expanding the range of existing collaborations between mathematicians and biologists based in the United States and Asia. Additionally, the grant brings a group of young mathematical researchers from U.S. institutions, providing a venue for graduate students to speak about their own research, as well as to participate in the workshop activities. Introducing young researchers to a broader international community is very important, both to expose them to new research opportunities and to facilitate the scientific interactions between the younger generation of U.S. mathematicians and their international peers and international senior researchers.</AbstractNarration>
