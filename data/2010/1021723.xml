    <AbstractNarration>Recent advances in sociogenomics allow for comparative analyses of molecular mechanisms regulating the development of social behavior. In eusocial insects such as ants, one aspect of their sociality, the division of labor, has received the most attention. A key question is how do ant workers in a nest organize all of their necessary behaviors or tasks when no single ant is in control? The answer lies in a mechanism that is very similar to the one we use to organize our own daily activities - an internal molecular rhythm generator called the circadian clock. The goal of this project is to characterize the genetic structure of the ant circadian clock and study the evolution, development, and function of task-specific circadian rhythms in harvester ants, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis. The expression patterns of the five principle clock genes will be analyzed in field and laboratory colonies of harvester ants in order to determine when circadian rhythms and clock function develop in harvester ants and to explore how genes that regulate circadian rhythms are associated with specific tasks. The results will shed light on how evolutionary history and environmental factors influence a molecular mechanism that regulates rhythmic behavior. Because the circadian clock is conserved across diverse taxa, ranging from ants to mice to humans, the work will have an impact on our general understanding of the role of molecular clocks in the synchronization of animal behavior with the external environment. In addition, the project will provide interdisciplinary research opportunities for underrepresented students and introduce undergraduates to cutting-edge techniques in genomic and behavioral research. Finally, this project provides an ideal platform for public outreach efforts to communicate evolutionary and behavioral research because people can easily relate to the topic of circadian rhythms, for example, as it relates to jetlag.</AbstractNarration>
