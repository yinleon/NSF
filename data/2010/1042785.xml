    <AbstractNarration>The investigators propose is to establish a general statistical methodology to&lt;br/&gt;estimate error rates for any of the existing second-generation&lt;br/&gt;sequencing technologies. They have identified an approach that is broadly&lt;br/&gt;applicable, fast, and easy to implement. Important strengths are that it&lt;br/&gt;only requires intensity data; it is applicable to the data types that&lt;br/&gt;are typically shared publicly; and it does not require the availability&lt;br/&gt;of a reference genome or genomes ---a key condition in threat detection&lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sequencing is a technology to read small words made out of DNA or RNA.&lt;br/&gt;In may applications across biology we need to identify words that occur&lt;br/&gt;in a book where they are not supposed to be (for example mutations in&lt;br/&gt;cancer or pathogens in the intestinal flora). Often these 'bad' words&lt;br/&gt;are similar to other words which occur elsewhere in the book, differing&lt;br/&gt;only by a letter or two. As seqeuncing is not free of errors, to know&lt;br/&gt;whether we are seeing a bad word or a poorly read good word we need to&lt;br/&gt;know how easy it is to misread a letter. This proposal is to assess&lt;br/&gt;exactly this, with the goal of providing better foundations to all&lt;br/&gt;scientific research that uses sequencing.</AbstractNarration>
