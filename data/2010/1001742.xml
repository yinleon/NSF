    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;Objectives: In this proposal we will provide the enabling science and technical underpinnings that will move sensing with N/MEMS beyond the realm of a scientific curiosity. We will investigate the dissipation of diverse resonant N/MEMS operating in air, leading to optimized performance in air, the carrier gas from which analytes will be sensed. We will also enable and demonstrate sensing of volatile organics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit rests on our three pronged approach: 1. To reduce radiated sound energy that damps the motion of resonators in air, making the resonant frequency shift a more sensitive transduction mechanism. 2. To investigate tensile stress to increase the Q in polysilicon and other low loss materials and also expose the origin of the enhancement of Q by stress. 3. To explore stress-based sensing where an analyte in the air induces a change in stress in a functionalizing coating on a surface &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts for the proposed research extend to high Q systems under investigation for quantum computation as mechanical qubits (the Q providing a high fidelity). Our research will enable diverse sensing functions for security and threat recognition from chemical and biological agents. Other benefits will flow from our planned REU and K-12 initiatives. The integration of undergraduates in aspects of the research and links to applications will benefit a broad spectrum of junior scientists, and equip them with practical problem-solving knowledge that extends beyond the classroom or laboratory environment.</AbstractNarration>
