    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to understand the tribochemical behaviors of adsorbate molecules on solids under equilibrium conditions and develop chemical strategies that inhibit the formation of detrimental tribochemical reaction products. The specific goal is to prevent the formation of so-called frictional polymers at electrical and sliding contacts associated with microelectromechanical system (MEMS) containing moving parts. The frictional polymer increases contact resistance of metal switch components. It can also cause power dissipation problems if too much is produced in narrow moving gaps. The main hypothesis is that surface reactions on tribologically stressed or activated solid surfaces are responsible for frictional polymer formation. The surface chemistry knowledge obtained form heterogeneous catalysis studies will be utilized to understand and control chemical reactions at tribological interfaces. A combination of innovative surface analysis techniques will be employed to attain meaningful chemical information of the interfacial species and find the optimum vapor environments that can assure the wear-free operation as well as prevent detrimental tribochemical reactions from occurring at MEMS interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge gained in this study will help understand the tribochemical fundamentals governing the interfacial friction and wear behaviors in ambient conditions and establish a new paradigm for extended operation of MEMS devices with full mechanical motions such as sliding, hinges, rotations, etc. Several graduate and undergraduate researchers will be immersed into multi-disciplinary and multi-scale research environments, gaining unique perspectives on the insertion of new knowledge into technical applications. The research activities and outcomes of the project will be utilized for underrepresented group outreach and as study examples in class.</AbstractNarration>
