    <AbstractNarration>Wireless networks are increasingly popular as the last-mile solution for a ubiquitous communication infrastructure. This trend in combination with the users? growing interest and falling cost in accessing vast amount of resources in Internet wirelessly has driven the developments of hybrid wireless network architecture such as Internet-based mobile ad hoc networks (IMANETs) and Internet-based vehicular ad hoc networks (IVANETs). However, it brings critical challenges in terms of limited storage space, frequent disconnections due to mobility, as well as unreliability of communication links. Caching a frequently accessed data in a local storage is shown to be an effective technique not only to relieve the network but also to improve data accessibility and availability in the presence of such challenges. The specific goal of this project is to develop algorithms and communication protocols that allow efficient and correct data caching in Internet-based wireless mobile networks. This project investigates cache management and invalidation strategies for IMANETs, and cache invalidation and consistency strategies for IVANETs. The project will make significant advances in understanding and designing an efficient data caching schemes for Internet-based wireless mobile networks. The success of this project will have a much broader impact on Internet-based wireless mobile network education and the corresponding industry, and provide versatile research opportunities to both undergraduate and graduate students. The algorithms and techniques developed in this research will be integrated with the education curricula</AbstractNarration>
