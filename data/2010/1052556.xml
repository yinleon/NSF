    <AbstractNarration>Immunity of plants against pathogenic microorganisms is often mediated by disease resistance genes (aka R-genes). R-genes encode proteins that trigger immune responses upon specific interactions with pathogen molecules. Each plant is equipped with a large number of R-genes that protect it against a wide variety of pathogens. This project is focused on the EDM2 gene of the model plant species Arabidopsis. EDM2 has previously been shown to contribute to plant immunity by activating some R-genes. However, mechanistic details of this process are unknown. Preliminary results of the investigators indicate that EDM2 controls the status of chromatin. Chromatin consists of DNA and various DNA-bound proteins. If the chromatin status of a given gene is compact, the respective gene is inactive. Activation of a gene requires de-compaction of its chromatin by loosening the binding of proteins to its DNA. Using methods of molecular biology and biochemistry the investigators will examine how EDM2 controls the chromatin status of R-genes. Based on their preliminary results they anticipate that the protein encoded by EDM2 is recruited to some R-genes by docking to specific features of chromatin at these genes and that it locally modifies their chromatin. Besides providing deep insight into the function of EDM2 and its role in plant immunity, this project will also widen our understanding of chromatin dynamics. This knowledge will facilitate the development of new strategies to improve disease resistance and other important traits of crop plants. Furthermore, the project will provide training to post-doctoral scientists as well as undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
