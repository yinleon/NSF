    <AbstractNarration>David Nesbitt of the University of Colorado at Boulder is supported by an award from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism program in the Chemistry division to study state-resolved spectroscopy and dynamics of chemical transients. The overall goals of this experimental program are threefold: i) to exploit high sensitivity direct absorption IR laser methods for study of jet-cooled radicals and fundamental molecular ions in slit supersonic discharges, ii) to augment these spectroscopic tools for quantum state-resolved collision studies at gas-ionic solution interfaces, and iii) to utilize time-resolved fluorescence microscopy methods for study of folding/unfolding kinetics at the single molecule level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highly reactive, very-short lived molecular species are important for many processes, ranging from atmospheric chemistry at the marine boundary to chemistry in the interstellar media. Additionally, this project involves using single molecular spectroscopy to study the kinetics of folding and unfolding of RNA molecules which is important to our understanding of many biological processes. A diverse group of individuals are involved the research including women and underrepresented minorities. The PI is also the Director of the "CU Wizards" Scientific Outreach program which organizes hands-on lecture/demonstrations for elementary and middle school students.</AbstractNarration>
