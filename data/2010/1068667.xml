    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports a program of two experiments at Jefferson Lab which will use the parity-violating asymmetry in the scattering of polarized electrons to search for evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model. The experiments are the ongoing Qweak measurement and a proposed new experiment for the 12 GeV era at Jefferson Lab, the MOLLER experiment. The first will provide a measurement of the proton's weak charge to 4% precision, and the second will make a 2.3% measurement of the weak charge of the electron. The two results will be complementary, as they are differently sensitive to possible parity-violating new physics, and both have a projected reach for new physics of this kind at the few TeV scale. The grant supports the PI as well as three graduate students, as well as undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal broader impact of this project is graduate and undergraduate student education. The grant supports three graduate students as well as one undergraduate student; other undergraduates will be involved as well via the senior research projects that are required of all William &amp; Mary physics majors. The PI served on a panel that reviewed the "Standards of Learning" for physics in K-12 education for the Commonwealth of Virginia, and helped to develop a related online resource textbook, and will partner with local schools to help implement the revised standards.</AbstractNarration>
