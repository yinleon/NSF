    <AbstractNarration>Miscommunication between people from different racial and ethnic groups represents one of the most fundamental challenges to improving intergroup relations. Miscommunications fuel tensions and distrust, hinder rapport building and cooperation, and help to sustain prejudice and discrimination. Understanding how to promote more effective intergroup communication is crucial for improving race relations. The proposed research will examine the process of communication between two newly acquainted individuals by utilizing experimental methods that consider the perspectives of both Whites and ethnic minorities in tandem within the context of the same interaction, and will examine both "single-shot" and repeated laboratory interactions. In addition, the proposed research program will contribute to current theoretical models of interracial communication by drawing from theory and research from the domains of person perception, close relationships, and goal pursuit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has implications for how communication operates within multiple interracial interaction contexts including groups of individuals working toward a shared goal (e.g., co-workers, classmates, and teammates), authority figures and subordinates (e.g., bosses and employees, teachers and students, police officers and civilians), and two individuals of equal status who are working toward building a relationship (e.g., college roommates, neighbors, and friends). In addition, research findings from this research will not only be disseminated in scholarly outlets, but will also be shared with non-academic and administrative organizations at the investigator's university. Lastly, the research will involve mentoring and training ethnic minority graduate and undergraduate students to prepare them for careers in psychology and related fields, with a particular emphasis on understanding issues of diversity and interpersonal and intergroup communication.</AbstractNarration>
