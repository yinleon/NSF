    <AbstractNarration>The project focuses on using laser scanners capable of measuring large objects in space, an important attribute for structural assessment after an earthquake event. A 3D point cloud representing the structure?s surface is delivered as the outcome of the laser scanning. We will have all laser scans geo-referenced at surveying grade accuracy allowing us to create a combined database of photo images and the laser scans. We will scan an array of buildings in different damage states, particularly in two of the sample blocks in Port-au-Prince previously surveyed by both the World Bank from the aerial photos and by two members of the team using on-the-ground surveillance. There are approximately 45 buildings in these two city blocks with a range of damage states. One objective of this effort is to see if the scanning would be an appropriate way to corroborate damage from aerial surveys. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide information for the first time on the use of high definition laser scanning and the merits and difficulties of using this advanced technology in a reconnaissance effort after a major disaster. This unique deployment of field measurements will provide an important benchmark for image-based remote sensing evaluation and future advancement of our capabilities for damage assessment of structural systems using the collected detailed data in this project. The laser scanning and other conventional data, e.g. material properties and collection of design data will improve our preparedness in situations of similar disasters in the US or worldwide. The information gathered will be instrumental in guiding the delivery of US aid for the reconstruction of Haiti.</AbstractNarration>
