    <AbstractNarration>The Noyce Scholarship Program of Northern Colorado is increasing the number of science and mathematics teachers in high-need school districts, especially in rural communities of northeastern Colorado. The program provides scholarships ($16,000 per year) to 22 highly qualified juniors and seniors in science and mathematics (STEM) majors who also are completing the teacher preparation program at the University of Northern Colorado; and the program provides scholarships ($16,000 per year) to 8 STEM professionals that return to complete the qualifications for their science and mathematics teaching licenses. Each Noyce Teacher is committing to teach at least two years in a high-need school for each year of scholarship they receive. After graduation, each Noyce Teacher is assigned an experienced mentor and supported with focused seminars during their induction year of teaching. All Noyce participants are building a lasting professional learning community for mutual support using a social networking site. The University of Northern Colorado has an articulated partnership with 11 school districts and is developing agreements with eight other school districts. The total student population is 42,803 in these 19 school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To build the pool of STEM teacher candidates, 80 freshmen and sophomores are receiving paid internships that provide them with K-12 teaching/tutoring experiences and encourage them to consider teaching as a profession. The program's intellectual merits are building on the successful teacher preparation program of the University of Northern Colorado, addressing the specific challenges of teaching in rural communities, and finally, producing more STEM teachers. The program's broader impact is meeting the need for more science and mathematics teachers in the U. S., especially in high-need and rural school districts. Through its activities, the program increases recruitment and retention of highly qualified science and mathematics teachers.</AbstractNarration>
