    <AbstractNarration>1039785&lt;br/&gt;Stewart&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will lead to the acquisition of a state-of-the-art confocal scanning laser microscope at the Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE). The CBE is a graduated NSF Engineering Research Center and is the largest, oldest, and best-known center for biofilm science, education, and technology transfer in the world. The new instrument will come with multiple features such as fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) capability for probing biofilm molecular microenvironments; an ultra violet (UV) laser for imaging blue fluorescence; a heated stage and inverted microscope, to allow medically relevant biofilm imaging; unlimited RAM, which will effectively remove a technological barrier to most experiments; and new fast scanning and sensitive detection technology, all of which will enable truly innovative science in the biofilm field. This acquisition will replace a 7-year-old microscope that is functionally obsolete. The request to NSF is matched by an award from the M. J. Murdock Charitable Trust (45% of total project cost). Direct microscopic observation has been one of the most powerful tools in developing insight into the complex, spatially structured behaviors in microbial biofilms. Confocal scanning laser microscopy in particular has become an essential instrument in the biofilm researcher's toolkit because of its ability to provide three-dimensional information non-invasively and in real time. This new microscope will facilitate interdisciplinary science and engineering on diverse topics ranging from algal biofuels to biofilms on medical devices.</AbstractNarration>
