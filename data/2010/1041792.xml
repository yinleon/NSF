    <AbstractNarration>Mentoring initiatives and activities have had a significant positive effect on education at many levels. This workshop is designed to establish a mentoring community of renowned mentors in an effort to create a national resource of faculty and educators who have excelled in enhancing Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education. This effort brings together for the first time nationally recognized Mentors who have been awarded the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM). The workshop hosts discussions to inform successful strategies for establishing several key features for the initiation of the mentoring community. These key features include 1) establishing a Community of Mentoring Leaders in STEM fields; 2) establishing a sub-group of Mentors that can serve as a national resource for agencies, committees, and advisory groups by providing information on best practices for policy development relevant to strengthening STEM education throughout the nation; 3) establishing a learning community environment for Mentors that supports the opportunity for enhanced collaboration and connectivity ; and 4) establishing pathways of knowledge transfer for sharing of best practices and increasing dissemination efforts. These efforts are aimed at substantially enhancing future dissemination and subsequent adoption of best mentoring practices. Strategies for effectively evaluating and assessing mentoring programs will also be discussed during the workshop.</AbstractNarration>
