    <AbstractNarration>1029135&lt;br/&gt;Callahan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to purchase a liquid isotope water analyzer for research and teaching at the College of Charleston. A Picarro wavelength-scanned cavity ring-down spectroscopy (WR-CRDS) analyzer, which is capable of simultaneously measuring oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in liquid water and vapor samples will be purchased. The system will be configured with the analyzer, autosampler and a liquid sample vaporizer. Additionally, the system includes a computer control module and assembly components. The instrument will be administered and maintained by the PIs with considerable roles for MS and undergraduate students to assist in maintenance. PIs will entertain users from other departments on an ad hoc basis. The analyzer will be put to use to better understand regional watershed hydrochemistry ? determining streamflow components and estimating residence times, coastal geological processes ? with emphasis on determining subsurface groundwater movement and submarine groundwater discharge, and cave and karst hydrology - water and hydrogen isotopes will be analyzed before and during rain events and over seasons to understand carbonate aquifers. The system will be made available to students in multiple disciplines. It will be used throughout College of Charleston?s Geosciences education program in which independent research is strongly emphasized. The analyzer will be used to provide near real-time stable isotope values for coastal water depth profiles, allowing students to understand coastal dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
