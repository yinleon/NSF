    <AbstractNarration>This proposal will support participants from the US to a workshop in Autrans, France, during the period March 20-25, 2011. The workshop is part of an ongoing effort to advance the understanding of representation varieties from the analytic, topological and dynamical viewpoints, and to probe more deeply their relationship to other branches of mathematics and mathematical physics. The central themes of the conference are moduli of representations and higher Teichmueller theory, but other topics include problems in quantization, probability, hyperbolic geometry, and geometric analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will bring together leading researchers from around the world. The workshop will provide a combination of introductory talks on important subjects related to the main themes, as well as more specialized research talks on the latest developments. Graduate students and postdocs especially will benefit from the introductory lecture series and the opportunity to interact with mathematicians in the field. The subject area of the conference, the geometry and topology of moduli spaces, is an extremely active field that continues to play a central role in current mathematics research. It has also attracted many new Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers. The workshop is an opportunity for this diverse group of mathematicians working in related fields to interact, share ideas, begin new collaborations, and advance the field.</AbstractNarration>
