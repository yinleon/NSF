    <AbstractNarration>Life on Earth depends on the consumption of plant biomass by microorganisms. While soil-dwelling microorganisms degrade and consume tremendous amounts of plant biomass, we know little about how they do it. This is an important process for study, and an improved understanding of the metabolism could lead to strategies for the production of high value chemicals and/or fuels from low cost and abundant plant biomass. This CAREER project is focused on elucidating mechanisms of plant biomass consumption by bacteria. Most of the published research on plant biomass consumption has been focused on higher microorganisms (fungi), and this bacterial-focused research project will provide interesting and useful counterpoints to our current understanding of microbial metabolism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;This research project will provide educational and training opportunities for graduate students and undergraduates who are working with the principal investigator. In the first four years of his independent career at Brown University, the PI trained six graduate students and twenty undergraduates. Similar numbers of trainees will be involved with this project. Beyond the activities at Brown, an integral component of the project is a research/education partnership with teachers and ethnically diverse students at high schools in Providence, Rhode Island and in Brown University-sponsored summer programs. The principal investigator has also formed a partnership with his alma mater, Morehouse College, America's only all male, historically black college to involve additional individuals from under-represented groups in the research project. This partnership involves annual trips to Morehouse College for mentoring activities and opportunities for Morehouse students to carry out research at Brown University during the summers. In addition to training future scientists, the outreach activities in this project will enhance public awareness of science. The findings of the project will contribute to environmental science and the development of new alternative energy technologies.</AbstractNarration>
