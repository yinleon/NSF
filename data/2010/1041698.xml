    <AbstractNarration>This project's goal is to develop innovative statistical approaches to&lt;br/&gt;multi-study genomic data analysis. Specific targets include&lt;br/&gt;generalization of meta-analysis tools used in medicine and social&lt;br/&gt;sciences to the genomics context, metrics for evaluating reproducibility&lt;br/&gt;of expression measurements across platform in the absence of a gold&lt;br/&gt;standard, approaches for deriving and validating common expression&lt;br/&gt;scales across platforms, and a novel reformulation of the combination&lt;br/&gt;problem based on constructing ``coexpression matrices'' in which an&lt;br/&gt;element represents the coexpression of a subset of genes in a given&lt;br/&gt;study. The project includes software implementation, application to a&lt;br/&gt;set of representative genomic analyses, and development of public-domain&lt;br/&gt;support website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genomics studies are studies that measure simultaneously the activity of&lt;br/&gt;a large portion of the thousands of genes in a biological system. These&lt;br/&gt;have given a great impulse to the life sciences in the past decade, and&lt;br/&gt;changed the way in which biology, medicine, and biotechnology make&lt;br/&gt;progress. A large number and variety of genomics studies are accruing.&lt;br/&gt;Because of cost and difficulty in the acquisition of biological samples,&lt;br/&gt;especially in medicine, the majority of genomic investigations are&lt;br/&gt;carried out using a limited number of samples, and focus on highly&lt;br/&gt;specific problems. This scenario poses two important questions for the&lt;br/&gt;genomics community. First, given the wide variety of genomic&lt;br/&gt;technologies and protocols, there is concern about reproducibility of&lt;br/&gt;genomic findings across technologies and laboratories. How can one&lt;br/&gt;systematically use the large body of genomic information available to&lt;br/&gt;assess reproducibility? Second, given the large, but fragmented and&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous, set of studies that are accruing, there is concern about&lt;br/&gt;the ability of the scientific community to efficiently integrate the&lt;br/&gt;resulting knowledge. How can one perform analysis of genomics data&lt;br/&gt;across studies, across technologies and across related biological&lt;br/&gt;systems? This project's overall goal is to address these two questions&lt;br/&gt;by developing data analysis tools for comparison and integration of&lt;br/&gt;genomic information across studies, across measurement technologies and&lt;br/&gt;across biological systems. Today, multi-study genomic analysis are rare,&lt;br/&gt;despite the wide availability of genomic data in the public domain. The&lt;br/&gt;premise underlying this proposal is that this is due in large part to&lt;br/&gt;the lack of specific, systematic and rigorous statistical approaches and&lt;br/&gt;the associated software tools. This project aims at providing such tools&lt;br/&gt;and therefore, if the investigator's premise is correct, will promote a&lt;br/&gt;more extensive, more efficient and more rigorous use of the vast&lt;br/&gt;resources made available by the massive investment made on genomic&lt;br/&gt;studies.</AbstractNarration>
