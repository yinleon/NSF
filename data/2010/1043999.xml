    <AbstractNarration>This project is evaluating the effect of data-logging and GIS technology on student learning and engagement when integrated into introductory geoscience courses at Valencia Community College, an urban, minority-serving institution. The affordable data-logging technology allows students to collect and process physical data such as air and water quality information. With the addition of inexpensive GIS technology, students are assessing their collected data within a spatial context, adding an additional dimension to their understanding and interpretation of the physical world. The project is designed around two courses for non-majors: a laboratory physical geology course and a field-based course. In both courses, students are using data-logging and GIS technology to collect, process, and interpret data, as well as to present their conclusions to their instructor and peers. In the physical geology lab course, student learning is being enhanced by: 1) guided-inquiry using prepared activities, 2) open-ended inquiry activities using existing raw data sets, 3) open-ended inquiry where students collect, process, and interpret their own data, and 4) a combination of guided- and open-ended inquiry activities using data collected by the students and using public domain data sets (NOAA, USGS, etc.). In the summer field research course, students are carrying out authentic inquiries following a Research Experience for Undergraduates model. The summer research experience utilizes and builds on the skills developed by the students in the prerequisite physical geology laboratory course. Student learning and engagement are being evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative methods, and project results are being disseminated through a variety of active approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is providing undergraduate research experiences for a diverse, community college student population lacking access to industry or university research facilities. Students are being introduced to data-logging technology and inquiry activities that maximize the availability and use of limited geologic resources. Because these activities are focusing on data actually available for collection, students are developing a better understanding of local geologic resources. The project is informing numerous geoscience programs in regions with limited geologic resources and/or access to expensive research facilities by incorporating and evaluating affordable data-logging technology that can be used anywhere. Consequently, the project is developing a realistic and adoptable model for engaging community college students in authentic geoscience research.</AbstractNarration>
