    <AbstractNarration>The project is supporting the organization of a series of interactive web-based faculty development workshops to improve the participants' proposal writing skills for educational development projects that are submitted to the Transforming Undergraduate Education in STEM (TUES) Program and other NSF programs. The workshops, which are based on successful earlier efforts, are being presented by the engineering program directors of the Division of Undergraduate Education using webinar software. The principal investigator is organizing ten interactive-web-based proposal writing workshops with each involving 15-30 institutions and a 150-300 participants. He is scheduling the workshops, inviting all institutions with accredited engineering degree programs to participate, handling all questions and registration details, providing operational guidelines to local facilitators, and collecting and reviewing participant demographics and assessment data collected to improve the workshops. Working collaboratively, the investigator, the engineering program directors, and a panel of specially selected consultants are developing a TUES community of scholars program to raise engineering faculty awareness of the TUES Program, increase the number of TUES proposals, and aid engineering faculty to strengthen their TUES proposal writing skills. The broader impacts of this project include outreach to a large and diverse set of faculty who may not have access to proposal writing workshop in any other way. This enables a diverse group of faculty to become better prepared for writing more competitive proposals.</AbstractNarration>
