    <AbstractNarration>In response to the provisions of Section 7027 of the America COMPETES Act, which requires the NSF to conduct a study of laboratory equipment donations to elementary and secondary schools, this study will survey selected institutions of higher education (IHEs) and entities in the private sector to obtain data on their donations of surplus scientific instruments for K-12 classroom use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the study are to determine:&lt;br/&gt;(1) How often, how much, and what type of equipment is donated;&lt;br/&gt;(2) What criteria or guidelines the institutions and entities are using to determine what types of equipment can be donated, what condition the equipment should be in, and which schools receive the equipment;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Whether the donating institutions provide any support to, or follow-up with, the recipient schools; and&lt;br/&gt;(4) How appropriate donations can be encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The survey will employ a purposive sample drawn from three lists of NSF awardees in 2008-09: 1) the 100 top-funded NSF awardees overall; 2) the 100 top-funded Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) awardees; and 3) up to 100 top-funded awardees from 35 EHR programs (stratified by program). A sample of approximately 300 awardees will be drawn to ensure that it includes 75% IHEs and 25% private entities. Basic analyses will include descriptive statistics on each category of information requested by Congress broken out by Carnegie classification of IHEs, type and size of private entities, NSF organization funding awards, and levels of schooling.</AbstractNarration>
