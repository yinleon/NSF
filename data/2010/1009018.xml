    <AbstractNarration>Fires, floods, and other infrequent, large-scale disturbances can strongly affect the dynamics of species and ecosystems. These disturbances are becoming more frequent and severe as climate change takes effect; forest fires in the western United States, for example, have increased four-fold over the last 30 years. The effects of disturbance events are extremely difficult to study, because the events are often unpredictable in time and scale. As a result, there is great uncertainty about how disturbances such as fires alter communities and ecosystems. Does wildfire, for example, harm or help vulnerable fish populations, and under what conditions? This research investigates how changes triggered by fire spread through time, space, and food webs. It focuses on the August 2009 wildfire that burned much of Scott Creek, a coastal California watershed containing populations of steelhead trout and coho salmon, both ESA-listed salmonids. Fortuitously, the spatial burn pattern created fire treatments of burned, unburned, and downstream reaches. Furthermore, there are extensive pre-fire datasets on the watershed, fish, and their food webs in all of these three fire treatments. This study will utilize a post-fire airborne LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) flight to characterize geomorphic change on the watershed scale. Nested within this detailed understanding of how fire changes the landscape, this study will use monitoring and experimental manipulations of food webs within each natural burn treatment to examine the importance of species interactions (including nonnative crayfish) in modulating the community response to fire. This project focuses on the short-term impacts of fire on streams (within 1 year), a critical but poorly understood period that likely determines the trajectories of community and ecosystem recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the work is to increase understanding of the interconnected responses of landscapes, ecological communities, and populations to major disturbance events. These data will help illuminate basic scientific questions regarding how large and infrequent disturbances drive ecological dynamics. This understanding will additionally provide information critical to effective, integrated management strategies for fire and imperiled fishes, informing questions about, for example, the extent to which wildfire should be prevented (or encouraged) in watersheds with populations of endangered fish. The project provides support for a research assistant who is preparing for graduate school, offering her valuable training and experience in a diverse set of field techniques and applications. Results will be made available to a broad audience via diverse media and communication outlets, ranging from websites to scientific publications.</AbstractNarration>
