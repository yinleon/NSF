    <AbstractNarration>Active galaxies (AGN) harbor a super-massive black hole at their core surrounded by an accretion disk. Little is known about the interaction between the accretion disk and the black hole, an interaction that produces powerful beamed jets of highly-energetic particles and radiation. The spectrum of this radiation is a strong indicator of the acceleration mechanisms involved. VERITAS, the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System, located in Southern Arizona at the Whipple Observatory Base camp, is an array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes designed to detect very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays (100 GeV - 50 TeV) that shower in the earth's atmosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the direct-detection of dark matter has not yet been achieved, indirect detection efforts involve searching for VHE gamma-rays. Dwarf galaxies and globular clusters are believed to be good candidates for dark matter because the virial velocities of the star populations within them exceed what is expected from the luminous matter and in fact give an indirect measure of the dark matter present. They are ideal for VHE gamma-ray searches because they are nearby and have no known VHE emitters within their cores. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will bring astrophysics experiences to Cal Poly. The goals of the proposed analysis effort are to improve the VERITAS gamma-ray detection algorithms and to use the improved sensitivity to study the acceleration mechanisms in AGN and to search for dark matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RUI grant will bring year-round research opportunities to two students. Undergraduate students will be given broad exposure to the science while working on a focused and tractable research project suitable for a senior thesis. Cal Poly is also one of the leading producers of high-school physics teachers in the state. The STAR program is an excellent venue for working with teachers to develop teaching supplements that can be used in 6th and 8th grade curricula where Science and Astronomy are taught.</AbstractNarration>
