    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;18 June 2010&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1043071&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI)&lt;br/&gt;PI: D. Fisichella&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests operational funding to support the UNOLS East Coast Winch Pool in CY 2010. The equipment pools support scientific operations aboard vessels in the US academic research vessel fleet as well as other federally-supported science projects aboard US government and non-government research vessels. The types of winches available (or soon to be available) through the pools include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Light-duty direct pull winches&lt;br/&gt;2. Medium-duty direct pull and traction winches&lt;br/&gt;3. Heavy-duty traction winches (JASON winch)&lt;br/&gt;4. Mooring recovery winches&lt;br/&gt;5. Specialized handling systems such as GEO Traces and Long Core&lt;br/&gt;6. Portable cable spoolers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These winches and handling systems support a wide variety missions on all UNOLS vessels. The UNOLS East Coast Winch Pool, and corresponding West Coast Winch Pool at Scripps, will also serve to ensure that the equipment meets current UNOLS standards, provides commonality of design, and provides proper maintenance, administrative and logistical support to the academic fleet and the science community at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The PI addressed the Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit of the proposed UNOLS East Coast Winch Pool. The shared-use equipment purchased, and the administrative structure established to support the equipment, will provide improved services to both the vessel operators and the scientific community. The Winch Pool structure will also ensure proper maintenance of equipment, commonality of design, compliance with current standards, and efficiencies to NSF with regard to logistics, tracking and oversight of certain shared-use assets. The research projects supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute participates in a large number of outreach programs including web broadcasts from vessel while at sea, open house events, and other initiatives such as ?Dive and Discover? with the submersible ALVIN.</AbstractNarration>
