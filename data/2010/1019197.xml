    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The central theme of this project is the memory of the initial state in quantum systems in between order and chaos. While this question is immensely complicated in classical systems, it turns out to be possible to identify a limited class of quantum systems for which relatively simple quantitative predictions can be made. This project is devoted to worked examples. The first of them is two atoms in a guide. The second consists of five two-dimensional strongly interacting atoms on a lattice. The third is a two-component mixture of atoms in two coupled traps. In all three cases, the group will be testing a simple formula that relates the values of observables after relaxation from an initial excited state to their initial values. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: Interdisciplinary by nature, the project lies on the interface between Atomic,Many-Body, and Mathematical Physics, Nonlinear Science, and Complex Systems. It will provide analytical and numerical experience for undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Massachusetts Boston. The PI will also work on an undergraduate-oriented book [Quantum Mechanics by order of magnitude, World Scientific, c. 2010] devoted to qualitative methods, a set of skills used by many and taught nowhere.</AbstractNarration>
