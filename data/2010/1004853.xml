    <AbstractNarration>This award, made to Rice University by the NSF Divisions of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) and Chemistry (CHE), in the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO) and Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), respectively, will provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 students, during the summers 2010-2012. The focus of the program is biological networks -- the complex interactions among biomolecules that give rise to the diverse biological phenotypes observed in nature. The goal is to provide students first hand experience with cutting-edge interdisciplinary research that is needed to predict biological functions sufficiently in order to reprogram cells to avoid diseases or to perform new tasks. In the REU program, students will work on research projects under faculty mentors that draw from a range of approaches (classical biochemical and genetic to theoretical models that require computation) to study naturally-occurring genetic networks, artificial genetic and metabolic networks, and biomolecular structure, function, and evolution. This program will also provide: a creative opportunity for students to develop innovative biotechnological ideas; leadership development; seminars and career development workshops; stipend and travel support; on-campus housing; a capstone research poster symposium; and an ethics and responsible conduct of research discussion seminar. Students will be recruited nationwide, with particular emphasis on recruiting women and under-represented minorities, and selection of students will be done based on the faculty steering committee's evaluation of each applicant's transcript, personal statement regarding their interest and motivation for research, and recommendation letters. Assessment of this program is done via pre- and post-questionnaires as well by using the NSF-supported common assessment tool. More information on this program can be obtained online at https://ibb.rice.edu/ or by contacting Dr. George Bennett (Principal Investigator) or Lisa Blinn (Program Coordinator) at 713-348-4671 or lisa.s.blinn@rice.edu.</AbstractNarration>
