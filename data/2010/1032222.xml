    <AbstractNarration>This NSF award by the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering program supports the participation of US investigators and graduate students in the 8th International Conference on Metabolic Engineering (ME VIII) to be held in Jeju Island, Korea, June 13-17, 2010. Metabolic Engineering (VIII) 2010: Metabolic engineering for green growth. A matrix system approach is organized under the aegis of Engineering Conferences International (the successor program to United Engineering Foundation Conferences program). The chairperson is Dr. Sang Yup Lee (KAIST, Korea) and the co-chairs are Prof. Elmar Heinzle (Saarland University, Germany) and Dr. Mervyn de Souza (Cargill).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Metabolic Engineering Conference is one of the first among several conference series related to biotechnology sponsored by the Engineering Foundation (now ECI) and started 20 years ago with the original title recombinant DNA technology. It has been the first conference with explicit focus of the application of recombinant DNA technology to the engineering of microorganisms for industrial microorganisms and processes. These conference series have been instrumental in addressing issues contemporary to technological advancements, engineering research and to education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Metabolic Engineering conference serves as the premier meeting for the metabolic engineering community. The 8th Metabolic Engineering conference will continue to be a leading conference for sharing the state-of-the-art developments and achievements made in the field of metabolic engineering over the last two years. The main theme of Metabolic Engineering VIII is Metabolic Engineering for Green Growth. The conference will have sessions that integrate the recent achievements made in the fields of systems biology, synthetic biology, biochemical engineering, tools and methods, and emerging techniques, healthcare, biofuel, biorefinery, environmental biotechnology, microbial system, mammalian system, plant system, and other disciplines and applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference organizers expect that the conference will provide comprehensive coverage of the state of the art and future directions in metabolic engineering. Indeed, Metabolic Engineering meetings are the premier forums for scientists and engineers who are at the cutting edge of all research directions within Metabolic Engineering. The resulting cross-fertilization of ideas enriches and strengthens the discipline as a whole. 300 participants are expected from 15 different countries.</AbstractNarration>
