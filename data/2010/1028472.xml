    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to design, fabricate and test microwave circulators that operate in the band between 5 and 50 GHz utilizing magnetostatic waves as the dominant energy transport mechanism. This will allow total device sizes of 1 Âµm or less for competitive integration with standard microelectronic processes. The approach is threefold 1) a simplified numerical model (i.e., Green's function or integral equation) will be developed 2) new materials processing techniques will be created for low conductivity dilute magnetic semiconductor materials and 3) dc bias circuitry will be fabricated.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit The proposed activity aims to dramatically change microwave ferrite circulator design approaches as well as communication/RADAR system functionality. Magnetostatic Wave phenomena will significantly change perspectives on nonreciprocal device operation and promises the extraordinary outcome of expanded bandwidths in smaller structures than are currently employed. In addition to these explicit outcomes, the proposed research is expected to provide glimpses of new applications and phenomena associated with magnetoelectric semiconducting effects of dilute magnetic semiconductor materials; new theories, models and devices are expected.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts The proposed activities integrate magnetostatic wave phenomena and dilute magnetic semiconductor material fabrication discoveries with significant teaching, training and learning activities. In particular, underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the proposed research wherever possible. Also, K-12 students will be included via presentations, workshops and laboratory tours. Results are planned for dissemination in top-tier peer-reviewed journals; intermediate results will be presented to the international community through conferences and symposia.</AbstractNarration>
