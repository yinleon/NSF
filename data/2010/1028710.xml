    <AbstractNarration>1028710-VERY LARGE SCALE INTEGRATED MEMS FOR MASSIVELY PARALLEL SCANNING PROBE NANOLITHOGRAPHY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop an enabling technology for low-cost high through-put parallel scanning probe nanolithography using micro-engineered electromechanical systems. The proposed systems include 2-dimensional arrays of nanoscale probe tips integrated on micro-actuators with nano-precision positioning capability in horizontal directions. An autonomous feedback mechanism integrated along with each probe provides an interactive real time control in the vertical direction to maintain a high level of uniformity between different probes.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Lithography at the nanometer scale is the key step in manufacturing of next generation electronic and electromechanical components. Currently available probe-based high-precision nanolithography techniques are based on serial processing (direct writing) suffering from long processing time and cost-inefficiency for industrial applications. Most of the efforts to reach higher through-put using arrays of probes operating in parallel focus on the capability to address probes individually requiring extensive electrical connections, while the main issue of uniformity between different probes has not been adequately addressed. The proposed technology will lead to systems capable of generating a large number of similar nanoscale patterns in parallel with great uniformity. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This project contributes to development of powerful nanolithography tools for low-cost high through-put nano-manufacturing, as well as maskless micro and nanolithography for academic and R&amp;D environments. The training and involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in the research activities enables them to join the next generation micro/nano-engineering workforce. Special efforts will be taken to encourage the participation of students from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
