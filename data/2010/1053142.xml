    <AbstractNarration>Given the observed and predicted rates of planetary change, the next decade is particularly crucial for documenting and understanding natural and anthropogenic environmental effects at all spatial scales from the planetary to the microscopic and observations spanning time scales from geologic to those of individual chemical reactions. The disciplines of geobiology and low temperature geochemistry are integral to the overall scientific understanding of, and ultimately prediction of, planetary change. Given the urgency of these issues, identification and prioritization of research directions responsive to these challenges are extremely timely. At the same time, new vistas are opening up in other aspects of geochemistry. For example, there is an important interface between environmental geochemistry and human health that is just coming into focus. To help meet these and many other challenges, exciting new tools are becoming available capable of probing the mechanisms of geochemical and biogeochemical processes. To guide and advance future research programs in these research areas, the PI proposes a "Workshop on Future Directions in Geobiology and Low-Temperature Geochemistry," to be held in Washington DC, at the Geophysical Lab, Carnegie Institution of Washington campus on August 27-28, 2010. Approximately 25-30 scientists spanning a full range of expertise in geobiology and geochemistry will attend. The timing of the proposed workshop is designed to provide input to a National Research Council committee tasked to produce a document characterizing "Basic Research Opportunities in Earth Science" (BROES).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshop participants will derive from university and governmental organizations and will bring a breadth of expertise to bear. The potential impact of this workshop can be gauged by the success of a similar effort a decade ago. The earlier workshop titled "Directions and Priorities in Low-Temperature Geochemistry for the year 2000 and the Next Decade" was held in 1999 in Boston Massachusetts. The Boston workshop resulted in input to a previous BROES report, which in turn led to fostering new research directions. These new directions included "Critical Zone Studies" and an enhanced emphasis on geobiology.</AbstractNarration>
