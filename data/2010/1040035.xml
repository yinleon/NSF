    <AbstractNarration>Technical Summary: The PI will acquire an atomic force microscope coupled to a biological optical microscope to support a varied program of research involving faculty and students in the Advanced Materials Science and Engineering Center (AMSEC) at Western Washington University, and will be an integral part of a university- wide initiative promoting cross-disciplinary research and education in materials science. The instrumentation is necessary to support research in five academic departments (Chemistry, Physics, Geology, Biology, and Psychology) and would be used in about nine undergraduate science and engineering courses. The instrumentation will therefore impact not only the specific research programs described, but also help to catalyze and promote a broader, College-wide initiative in materials research and education. WWU is a predominately undergraduate institution, and a considerable component of the project is aimed at training students in the use of state-of-the-art instrumentation in laboratory coursework and involving undergraduates in meaningful, cutting-edge research. Specific research projects that will directly benefit from the instrumentation include measurement of charge transport and trapping in hybrid conjugated polymer/metal nanoparticle films for organic electronics, understanding morphology of films formed via organic vapor-liquid-solid deposition as well as liquid crystal imprinting, coupled magnetic force and optical measurements of newly developed magnetic surface-enhanced Raman active nanoparticles, imaging the self-assembling of protein nanowires, and understanding neural mechanisms of learning and memory through combined imaging and scanning probe measurements of neural responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layman Summary: &lt;br/&gt;The atomic force microscope (AFM) is a tool that allows researchers to characterize a variety of properties of materials and surfaces (including surface structure, mechanical, electrical, and magnetic properties) at size scales on the order of nanometers, even small enough to image individual molecules in some cases. The PI will acquire an AFM for the interdisciplinary Advanced Materials Science and Engineering Center (AMSEC) at Western Washington University, a predominately undergraduate institution that has a strong emphasis on engaging undergraduate students in meaningful, cutting-edge research. This instrumentation will be used to teach students about properties of materials and processes that occur on length scales inaccessible by traditional instrumentation in an undergraduate laboratory. It will also support research in five academic departments (Chemistry, Physics, Geology, Biology, and Psychology) in projects ranging from the study of brain function, to the magnetic properties of thin films, to understanding the optical and electrical properties of nanomaterials, materials that show promise in advancing technologies related to medicine, electronics, and communications. This project has a broad impact in bridging the gap between classroom and research lab. Acquisition of the proposed instrumentation will open new avenues for collaboration and cross-disciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>
