    <AbstractNarration>The world-wide web has become one of computing's great success stories,&lt;br/&gt;changing the way that people around the world communicate, compute,&lt;br/&gt;and conduct their business. Unfortunately, security problems on the web&lt;br/&gt;are prevalent, and these problems increase costs for website operators&lt;br/&gt;and for Internet users. This project aims to develop new methods for&lt;br/&gt;securing the web, providing website developers and operators with new&lt;br/&gt;and improved tools to protect their site and their users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research involves several technical directions. First, to help&lt;br/&gt;protect existing websites, this project will investigate ways of hardening&lt;br/&gt;legacy web application code to defend it against the most common attacks.&lt;br/&gt;Second, to provide a solid foundation for web systems of the future,&lt;br/&gt;this project will study how to provide robust protection for newly&lt;br/&gt;developed code. The project will also study web development frameworks&lt;br/&gt;that are safe by construction. Third, this project will develop tools&lt;br/&gt;and techniques to incrementally migrate existing web applications to&lt;br/&gt;next-generation safe-by-construction web frameworks. Fourth, this project&lt;br/&gt;will devise and carry out user studies to measure rigorously the effect&lt;br/&gt;of different programming languages, frameworks, and programming practices&lt;br/&gt;upon the security of web applications. The broader impacts resulting from&lt;br/&gt;the proposed activity are potentially significant; if it is successful,&lt;br/&gt;this research could have a significant positive impact on the security&lt;br/&gt;of web services and, in the longer term, on software security in general.</AbstractNarration>
