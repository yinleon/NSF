    <AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to: (1) To refine and apply a new experimental technique to measurements of the kinetic isotopic fractionation of water associated with evaporation and condensation; and (2) to calibrate a said instrument with traditional mass spectrometry techniques focusing on relatively low water vapor concentrations (&lt;6000 ppmv) and on the deuterium excess of water vapor. It is expected that both of these goals will be beneficial to a wide range of scientists with interest in hydrology and atmospheric climate dynamics. The PI has developed a novel experimental technique for measuring the fractionation associated with evaporation and condensation that takes advantage of the rapid analytical capabilities of newly commercially available laser-based cavity ring-down spectrometers (CRDS). The new technique has several advantages over traditional mass spectrometry as simultaneous, real-time measurements of water vapor concentration and water vapor hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios may be made. Preliminary evaporation data corroborate the published equilibrium fractionations (100% relative humidity), suggesting that this approach may provide a new way to advance understanding of isotopic fractionation during disequilibrium evaporation and condensation. This work is exploratory in nature and the approach largely untested and thus qualifies for an EAGER.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will provide a foundation for future research in a wide range of hydrologic and atmospheric research. The research methodologies developed in this project will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national conferences, and the project will partially fund the Ph.D. research of a female Ph.D. student.</AbstractNarration>
