    <AbstractNarration>Software Engineering (34)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focusing on the teaching of software testing principles and techniques at appropriate stages of the undergraduate Computer Science and Software Engineering education. Basic skills are introduced in beginner programming courses, and more advanced topics are covered at the high level courses. It not only encourages students to invest more time in testing and consequently produce programs with fewer bugs, but also to establish a correct concept and realize that testing is actually an integral part of the programming process rather than some afterthought, conducted in an ad hoc manner. An important innovation of this project is the development of modularized course material that is not based on specific testing techniques or tools, but rather according to the various aspects of software testing. There is a many-to-many relationship between courses and modules such that educational material can be selectively applied to any appropriate course in a minimum intrusive and non-restrictive way. This allows instructors to use their own discretion to determine which parts of each module are appropriate for their students. This project is providing appropriate training in software testing to students, not only to those who choose software testing as a profession, but also to those who might work in any aspect of software development. It is helping universities produce a well educated and well trained workforce that is critical to the success of the software industry.</AbstractNarration>
