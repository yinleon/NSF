    <AbstractNarration>The REU Site Polymer Science and Engineering at The University of Akron, a.k.a. UAkron-REU, is a nurturing academic environment for undergraduate exploration, education and research in science and engineering of polymeric materials, including its scientific challenges and future opportunities. Each year 10 NSF-funded undergraduate students from all over the country participate in the program where they gain practical, hands-on research experience in a fundamental aspect of polymer science or engineering. Summer interns choose the scientific area of their interest from among the many fields currently being pursued by the research faculties. The current scientific areas include: Polymer Chemistry, Physics, and Engineering, and Biomaterials. Summer interns have access to research equipment to carry out their projects. Moreover, extensive mentoring efforts are in place to help the interns develop as scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer program also has a rich educational component. Activities designed to provide perspective about future educational and career opportunities are integrated with mentored research activities including a one-week series of two-hour lectures about the fundamentals of polymer science and engineering, and a professional development series featuring panel discussions on career directions, ethics, and GRE preparation. In addition the interns organize: a faculty seminar series; Friday gatherings to discuss research progress; visits to various regional companies, government laboratories and local hospitals; and give an oral or poster presentation of research results at the Northeast Ohio Undergraduate Research Conference which is held in collaboration with Case Western Reserve University, Kent State University and NASA Glenn Research Center.</AbstractNarration>
