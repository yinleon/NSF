    <AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program is supporting the research of Professor Simon Friedman at the University of Missouri at Kansas City to develop and refine the method of Light Activated RNA Interference (LARI), a technique being developed to control gene expression with light. Specifically, with this tool, the Friedman group aims to exert spatial and temporal control of gene knockdown via RNA-interference, and also to control the extent of this knockdown. To refine the approach, new photolabile groups will be developed and attached to the termini of small RNAs (siRNA and dsRNA), and their ability to reduce gene expression with light will be assessed in model systems. This will include the light dependent knockdown of gene expression in transfected and endogenous gene targets. The refined method will be used to examine and address questions in a range of biological systems, including those related to developmental biology and tissue engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the training of students at the interface of chemistry and biology, the Broader Impacts of the proposed work are aimed at the community beyond the immediate scientific community affected by LARI. In the first of two projects, the PI will refine a series of demonstrations, previously developed to help students understand the universality of chemical principles by showing how they apply to non-laboratory situations. In a second proposed activity, the PI will organize a series of discussions about science for the local community. These will be centered on biographical science movies that described the life of famous scientists. The PI will use these films as a starting point to discuss the specific science that was being investigated, and also the nature of scientific inquiry, and how scientific questions are posed and ultimately addressed.</AbstractNarration>
