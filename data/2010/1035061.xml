    <AbstractNarration>Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is planning to join the existing Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled "Center for e-Design" currently comprised of Virginia Tech (lead), the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, and the University of Central Florida. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks support to establish Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) as an official site of the NSF IUCRC for e-Design and Realization of Engineered Products and Systems (e-Design Center). The overall center mission is the development of engineering tools that support the realization of IT-enabled design. The proposed research projects will expand the center scope into biomedical science, with emphasis on medical devices and software tools. The research utilizes CMU expertise in computer science, particularly human-computer interaction. The proposed site director has significant expertise in the target area, holding academic appointments in Computer Science and Bio-Medical Engineering at CMU as well as in the departments of Bioengineering and Surgery at the University of Pittsburgh. Through collaborative work with the other center research sites, this effort should increase the speed of adoption of engineering modeling and optimization in the medical field. Faculty representing a number of disciplines will be involved, and physicians will be included to provide rapid feedback to the researchers during device development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed deliverables from this proposal include development of new software tools that will both increase the competitive advantage of US companies, and increase the quality of care to patients. The technical component of the project, i.e. development and refinement of IT tools, has the potential for impact at the other I/UCRC research sites, the industry partners, and beyond. The team appears to have an excellent understanding of intellectual property management. The PI discusses the diversity plan in detail, and indicates that undergraduate and graduate students will be invited to participate in the e-Design center activities based upon their academic merits without regard to race, ethnicity, gender or origin. The plan presented in this proposal includes a highly integrated approach to research and education, particularly through Dr. Burgess, who will hold the position of Director of Clinical Translation, and currently teaches graduate and undergraduate Biomedical Engineering courses on "Surgery for Engineers."</AbstractNarration>
