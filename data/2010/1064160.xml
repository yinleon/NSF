    <AbstractNarration>1064160&lt;br/&gt;Volkov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed activity: The goal of this project is to determine the ioelectrochemical mechanisms of acquisition of external stimuli by plants, its transduction into electrical signals, memorizing and/or transferring these signals, and actuation of mechanical and chemical devices for defense or attack. We will study mechanosensory effects and propagation of electric potentials in plants. We will use novel non-invasive methods together with physiologically active agents that can give insight into mechanisms of different steps of signal transduction and responses in plant kingdom. This field has both theoretical and practical significance because these sensory systems employ new principles of stimuli reception and signal transduction and play a very important role in the life of plants. These principles are still very poorly understood. Our project exploits a new approach to plant biosensing. This integral project includes the development of a new low current measurement system; conduction of very delicate electrical and mechanical experimental studies of plant sensors; and development of new mathematical model of sensors in plants, while providing new understanding of basic mechanisms of biological sensing and actuation in plants. In the future refined plant sensors could find even broader application for monitoring atmospheric phenomena, acid rains, pesticides, heavy metal pollutants, molecular recognition of the direction of light and thermal shocks. Our current specific aims are as follows: 1) Studying mechanical plant sensors; 2)Studying passive and active electrical circuitry of plant sensors; 3) Studying mechanisms of actuation of mechanical devices in plants, delay lines and electrical memory; 4) Further development of the basic hydroelastic model of the Venus flytrap hunting; 5) Broadening the participation of individuals from underrepresented groups in the areas of physical, chemical, and bioengineering sciences supported by the NSF. These fundamental multidisciplinary studies are expected to demonstrate mechanisms of plants biosensing from electrical signal transduction to cascades of cellular events. &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact resulting from the proposed activity: Our project will open a new field of plant sensors engineering with dramatically increasing of sensitivity of new types of biosensors. This project also has important educational benefits for students in multidisciplinary education through research at the interfaces of plant biology, biophysics, biochemistry and electrical engineering. Such approach not only contributes to basic knowledge in science but provides an opportunity to integrate research and education. This project will attract new students from underrepresented groups in science through research opportunities. The main educational impact of this project would be providing research opportunities for undergraduate students at Oakwood University, a Historically Black College and University, who are enrolled in a joint engineering degree program with the University of Alabama in Huntsville. At the present time we have three female and one male African-American student in the ?Research and Independent Study? program who will be included to our new Sensors project.</AbstractNarration>
