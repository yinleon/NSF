    <AbstractNarration>Bioinformatics, Systems Biology and Intelligent Computing are synergistic interactive research&lt;br/&gt;disciplines that hold great promise for the advancement of research and development in complex&lt;br/&gt;biomedical systems, agricultural, environmental, pharmaceutical and medical sciences as well&lt;br/&gt;as public health, drug design, genomics and so on. Research and development in these two are impacting the science and technology of fields such as medicine, food production, forensics, agriculture, pharmacy, engineering and bio-mathematical and biophysical sciences by advancing&lt;br/&gt;fundamental concepts in molecular biology, in genomics and in medicine, by helping us understand living organisms at multiple levels, by developing innovative implants and prosthetics, by new medical image technologies, and by improving tools and techniques for the detection, prevention and treatment of diseases. The International Joint Conference on Bioinformatics, Systems Biology and Intelligent Computing (IJCBS 2009) provides a common platform for the cross fertilization of ideas, and to help shape knowledge and scientific achievements by bridging these two very important and complementary disciplines into an interactive and attractive forum. Keeping this objective in mind, IJCBS 2009 is aimed at promoting inter/multidisciplinary education&lt;br/&gt;and research by offering a number of keynote, tutorial and cutting-edge research lectures. IJCBS 2009 will host special sessions focusing on the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary education and research in order to foster collaboration between the bioinformatics, systems biology and intelligent computing domains in the USA and China. IJCBS09 will provide travel support for a number of selected USA students and scholars to attend the event.</AbstractNarration>
