    <AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;Magnetism is one of the oldest phenomena known to men, yet one of the most difficult to understand. Magnetic materials, typically made from metallic ions such as nickel or cobalt, have been known and used for centuries. This project will pursue a series of experiments to test whether magnetism can arise in materials where none of the constituents are magnetic by themselves. This goal will be pursued by modifying oxygen-based semiconductors through the introduction of atomic scale point defects, specifically making holes in the ordered network of oxygen atoms. These defects are expected to lead to an increase in the electrical conductivity of these oxide semiconductors, which can trigger the development of ferromagnetism. A combination of imaging and analytical techniques, the interplay among mobile electrons, electrical gating, and optical excitations, will be used to elucidate how magnetism develops in these semiconducting systems. This award will substantially advance the fundamental understanding of how ferromagnetism develops in materials that are intermediate between metals and insulators as well as provide important insight into materials for making new magnetic memory and logic devices, which could be used for advanced computing. The students participating in this project will be trained in advanced analytical techniques applicable to careers in the semiconductor/nanotechnology industries, as well as in academia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This project will pursue a series of experiments to test a number of mechanisms that have been proposed for the development of room temperature ferromagnetism in semiconducting transition metal oxides, rationalizing the properties of materials intermediate between local moment magnetism and itinerant magnetism. These properties include the interplay between localized moments, mobile charge carriers, and point defects, specifically oxygen vacancies. This will be accomplished by correlating the emergence of an increased electrical conductivity in oxygen deficient oxide semiconductors with the development of ferromagnetism. Using a unique combination of imaging and analytical techniques it is expected to be possible to elucidate how the shift in carrier concentration with the inclusion of non-magnetic ions and point defects, electrical gating, and optical excitations affects these magnetic properties and how local moments from transition metals interact with the oxygen vacancy to induce ferromagnetism. This award will substantially advance the fundamental understanding of ferromagnetism by probing in a controlled manner the magnetism in systems intermediate between insulators and conductors. The two Ph.D. students and multiple undergraduates participating in this project will be trained in advanced analytical techniques applicable to careers in the semiconductor/nanotechnology industries, as well as in academia.</AbstractNarration>
