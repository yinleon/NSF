    <AbstractNarration>The University of Washington (UW) proposes an extension for the Alliance for Access to Computing Careers (AccessComputing). AccessComputing engages individuals with disabilities as well as those who support, serve, guide, educate, and employ them in transformational efforts to make the computing disciplines more welcoming and accessible to individuals with disabilities, including post-9/11 veterans. AccessComputing, a combined effort of UW's Department of Computer Science and Engineering and DO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology) Center, in partnership with diverse set of postsecondary institutions, BPC Alliances, and computing organizations. The Alliance aims to (1) increase the capacity of postsecondary institutions, precollege educators, BPC Alliances, and industry to fully include individuals with disabilities in computing fields; (2) provide direct services to individuals using evidence-based practices that support those individuals as they move through critical junctures on the way to computing careers; (3) build synergistic and lasting relationships among stakeholders to promote systemic changes toward inclusiveness in computing education and careers; and (4) expand an online resource center to share research and successful practices worldwide. Applying methods grounded in knowledge management, collaboration, and social network theory and practice, this extension to the AccessComputing award will formalize earlier and new relationships into a multitier organizational structure of partners, collaborators, and affiliates. Outcomes for individuals with disabilities will be documented by tracking the progress of student participants as well as institutional enrollment and graduation data; and results will be compared to local, regional, and national data with respect to the academic and career success of people with disabilities.</AbstractNarration>
