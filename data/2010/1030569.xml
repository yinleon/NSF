    <AbstractNarration>The objectives of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) research project are to improve the understanding and to model the failure mechanisms of CMCs using an integrated approach based on novel multiscale computational methods and experimental validation. Revolutionary design of future power generation systems, rockets, and most recently, hypersonic missiles and flight vehicles are contingent on the development of advanced materials like ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), able to operate at high temperatures. A major challenge in the design of CMC components is the determination of the fracture behavior of these materials at relevant crack sizes for ceramic materials. Fracture of CMCs involves phenomena spanning several spatial scales from micron-size fibers to meter-size structural components. The University of Illinois will collaborate with researchers and engineers from General Electric Company to vigorously expand fundamental knowledge and modeling of damage mechanisms in CMCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research offers an alternative for the difficult and costly fracture experiments needed to determine the fracture behavior of CMCs. If successful, it will allow validated simulations and improve the understanding of complex multiscale phenomena. This will pave the way for the solution of important engineering and scientific problems. While the focus of his research is on the problem of failure of CMCs, this multiscale framework may also have a direct impact on the modeling and understanding of other material systems and problems where existing multiscale methods are not applicable. This research program will enable the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Illinois. These students will be involved in a multidisciplinary research topic that will foster critical interactions with researchers and engineers from General Electric Company. Another objective of this program is to motivate K-12 students to pursue an engineering degree. This will be achieved through the hands-on seminar Computational Mechanics, Engineering and Simulation Showcase (COME-&amp;-SEE), showcasing the environmental and economical impact of computational engineering sciences.</AbstractNarration>
