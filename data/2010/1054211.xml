    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to gain an understanding of how age-related mechanical&lt;br/&gt;changes in cells increase their susceptibility to being bound by the amyloid peptide and&lt;br/&gt;its aggregate forms. A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AB) is the rearrangement of the Ab to a&lt;br/&gt;non-native conformation that promotes the formation of toxic, nanoscale aggregates. The&lt;br/&gt;largest risk factor for AD is aging, and the proposed work aims to determine how mechanical&lt;br/&gt;changes in cells associated with aging increases the ability of AB to bind cellular surfaces. For&lt;br/&gt;these studies, age-related alterations of membranes will be mimicked by specific chemical and&lt;br/&gt;compositional alterations to lipid bilayers, which are models of a cells plasma membrane, prior&lt;br/&gt;to exposure to AB. In parallel, the ability of AB to bind to cells in culture, with chemically induced&lt;br/&gt;changes in mechanical properties designed to mimic ageing, will also be determined. Agerelated&lt;br/&gt;changes include oxidative damage, enhanced cholesterol content of the membrane, and&lt;br/&gt;disruption of cytoskeletal components. Scanning probe microscopy techniques will be applied to&lt;br/&gt;correlate mechanical changes, measured with nanoscale spatial resolution, of the model lipid&lt;br/&gt;bilayers and cells with their susceptibility to Ab binding and subsequent disruption.&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the proposed research would yield detailed understanding of how cellular surface&lt;br/&gt;properties associated with aging influence AB membrane binding, aggregation, and ultimately&lt;br/&gt;toxicity. The binding of Ab and its aggregate forms to cellular surfaces represents a fundamental&lt;br/&gt;step in potential toxic mechanisms associated with AD and has broader implications in&lt;br/&gt;protein/membrane interactions. The educational plan focuses on providing meaningful research&lt;br/&gt;experience to pre-service science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teachers,&lt;br/&gt;with a particular focus on pre-service teachers (PSTs) planning on careers in the region of&lt;br/&gt;Appalachia, as persons from economically-distressed counties in this region are&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented in STEM fields. The PSTs will develop a lesson or teachable unit based on&lt;br/&gt;their research activities that can be directly translated into the classroom. It is believed that&lt;br/&gt;participating PSTs will be able to improving science education in the region</AbstractNarration>
