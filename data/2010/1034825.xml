    <AbstractNarration>Following the earthquake of January 12, 2010, the current situation in Haiti provides an important opportunity to perform a feasibility study of the potential for mobile communications to enhance coordination between stakeholders both during and after the crisis. It is essential to conduct time sensitive research on the role of telecommunications in the Haitian disaster relief effort. The research team combines technical expertise with effective ground-level liaison through higher education and community association networks in Haiti. The goals are to (1) Assess network accessibility during and after the crisis; (2) Assess the level of interagency coordination; (3) Assess current use of mobile communication technology. The research questions address some of the principal considerations in the implementation of next generation coordination and response systems. This study is intended to provide a foundation for future research including the creation of collaborative tools, training approaches, and simulation materials for respondents to future extreme events. A partnership with the University of Fondwa, Haiti is an integral element of the research plan. The proposing team has made specific arrangements for transportation, housing, food, and water in Haiti.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bruce Hamilton&lt;br/&gt;Program Director&lt;br/&gt;Environmental Sustainability&lt;br/&gt;3/19/10</AbstractNarration>
