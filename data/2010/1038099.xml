    <AbstractNarration>The project proposed here integrates existing University of Michigan activities to increase participation of &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority students in STEM fields in three ways: (1) by attracting a new group of &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority students to doctoral education in biology, math and physics via master?s &lt;br/&gt;degree programs; (2) by enhancing and strengthening the intergenerational community among &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority scientists and engineers at all student and faculty levels of the University: (3) &lt;br/&gt;by strengthening the capacity of all faculty members to provide effective mentoring to students who come &lt;br/&gt;from educational and cultural backgrounds different from their own. &lt;br/&gt;Diversity in the STEM disciplines has only begun to reflect the diversity of the U.S. population. We believe &lt;br/&gt;it is urgent to encourage more of the nation's talented underrepresented minority undergraduates to &lt;br/&gt;pursue scientific doctorates by engaging them in research master's programs that will provide full funding &lt;br/&gt;and strong preparation for doctoral programs. The traditional path of moving students directly from &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate study to doctoral education has not accomplished the goal of increasing diversity in &lt;br/&gt;STEM, and may even be counterproductive. Some evidence suggests that underrepresented minority &lt;br/&gt;students are more likely than other students to pursue master?s degrees before committing to doctoral &lt;br/&gt;education. Our proposed master's programs aim particularly at attracting students in fields (ecology and &lt;br/&gt;evolutionary biology, mathematics and physics) where other efforts to diversify doctoral programs have &lt;br/&gt;been relatively unsuccessful. &lt;br/&gt;The master?s programs are thoughtfully designed to incorporate scientific rigor and active learning &lt;br/&gt;innovations. However, by themselves they are unlikely to be successful; our plans call for active &lt;br/&gt;contributions of key institutional partners. We will recruit and support students via a strong &lt;br/&gt;intergenerational community of underrepresented minority faculty and students at all levels in the &lt;br/&gt;University. To surround master's students with an intergenerational community we will take advantage of &lt;br/&gt;many existing programs currently aimed at either undergraduate or doctoral students. The master's &lt;br/&gt;students will also be supported in creating their own community within and across programs. We will &lt;br/&gt;develop the faculty to offer focused, competent and intentional mentoring. Strong and effective faculty &lt;br/&gt;mentoring will encourage these students to pursue doctoral education, and simultaneously will increase &lt;br/&gt;the campus capacity for excellent mentoring of underrepresented minority students at all levels. This &lt;br/&gt;program, then, will integrate our NSF-funded and UM-funded efforts to recruit and support URM students &lt;br/&gt;at all levels of science education. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;Our proposal is based on solid social science evidence about the support structures that predict the &lt;br/&gt;academic success of students from underrepresented groups. Moreover, it creates strong links between &lt;br/&gt;research excellence and successful educational outcomes for both students and faculty mentors, through &lt;br/&gt;deep ties across academic generations in research groups and faculty mentoring teams. It leverages &lt;br/&gt;existing federally-funded and university-supported resources (all of which have been carefully evaluated) &lt;br/&gt;to enhance underrepresented minority students' seamless transitions and ultimate success in academic &lt;br/&gt;science careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;By increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities in selected STEM fields, we seek to have a &lt;br/&gt;broader impact by attracting new students into doctoral education, and by providing URM students at all &lt;br/&gt;levels of university education with intergenerational community and wise mentoring. If successful, we will &lt;br/&gt;provide a new model of graduate education for URM students that can be shared across the STEM &lt;br/&gt;disciplines and disseminated to other research universities. Our successful students, as they complete &lt;br/&gt;master?s degrees and doctorates, will become mentors in their own right, and will generate "positive &lt;br/&gt;feedback" in the education system, moving the scientific workforce towards equitable representation by &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority groups. &lt;br/&gt;Â  &lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
