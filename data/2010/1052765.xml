    <AbstractNarration>Learning to hear novel speech sounds is one of the major challenges of mastering a second language (L2). Previous work using intensive auditory training has helped learners perceive challenging and unfamiliar speech sounds but no method to date has consistently brought learners to native levels. This research project by Yukari Hirata and Spencer Kelly at Colgate University attempts to improve upon previous methods by coupling auditory instruction with visual and motor information conveyed though hand gestures. Specifically, Hirata and Kelly will explore how observing and producing different types of gestures helps native English speakers learn novel speech sounds in Japanese. Hirata and Kelly will investigate this question using behavioral and brain measures and will explore whether mastering these novel speech sounds also leads to better L2 vocabulary learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the increasing contact among people all over the world, developing effective and efficient strategies for L2 teaching is more important than ever. The project also allows for integration of research into the educational experience of undergraduate students at a primarily undergraduate institution, exposing them to the excitement of scientific inquiry. Finally, strengthening on-campus laboratory facilities (that can be used by several disciplines) for the behavioral and neural investigation of foreign language learning will enrich and diversify undergraduate science education.</AbstractNarration>
