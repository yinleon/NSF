    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: In unicellular eukaryotes like yeast, genes are expressed in a cell cycle specific manner and in response to specific environmental cues during growth, development and homeostasis. Regulation of gene expression at the level of transcription (RNA synthesis) is controlled by a variety of mechanisms. One such mechanism involves formation of a looped architecture due to the interaction of the gene promoter with the terminator region. This interaction of the distal ends of a gene during transcription is referred to as gene looping. Research in this lab has further shown that gene looping accompanies activated transcription. First reported in yeast, gene looping is now emerging as a universal feature of RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes in eukaryotes. The ubiquity of gene looping and how it leads to increased transcriptional efficiency, however, remains unclear. The overall objective of this research is to define the molecular basis of loop formation and to determine the extent of gene looping on a genomewide scale in yeast. The successful completion of this project will reveal the general scope of gene looping in yeast. The protein-protein interactions that facilitate gene looping will also be defined. The findings of this project will serve as a paradigm for understanding the role of gene looping in higher eukaryotes like plants and mammals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project will be carried out at Wayne State University, which is located in the city of Detroit, Michigan. Many Wayne State students are residents of Detroit and thus represent the ethnic and economically diverse population. This project will provide a unique educational opportunity for training students, particularly those from underrepresented and economically disadvantaged groups. The ultimate goal is to enable undergraduate and graduate students to contemplate a scientific career. Simultaneously, this project will (i) provide opportunities for critical thinking and analysis of data; (ii) add value to student's educational experience by translating their excitement of knowledge into discovery; (iii) show how research in basic sciences is beneficial for the human society; (iv) exemplify that scientific progress requires a multidisciplinary approach; (v) inculcate team spirit and a sense of scientific cooperation among students; and (vi) provide training in oral and written presentation of the scientific work as well as mentoring experience to senior students.</AbstractNarration>
