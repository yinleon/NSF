    <AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;PI plans to investigate efficient generation of far-infrared radiation in 13-30 µm based on difference-frequency generation in MgO-doped periodically-poled LiNbO3 (PPLN) at room temperature. The efficient conversion is made possible by utilizing a completely novel configuration under which the two incoming optical waves propagate inside a proton-exchanged waveguide, whereas the far-infrared radiation is emitted from the waveguide surface. PI?s goal is to achieve four emission wavelengths, with the peak and average powers reaching 2 W and 200 µW, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Such a novel approach is based on a potentially transformative concept, i.e. by taking advantage of the surface-emitting geometry PI will be able to dramatically expand the wavelengths generated from a MgO-doped PPLN waveguide to an extremely wide range in the far-infrared region. Such an expansion will enable researchers from different disciplines to achieve transformative applications in chemical sensing, biological and bio-medical diagnostics and therapy, and explosive and chemical-agent detections. Presently, no emitter is capable of covering 13-30 µm under the room-temperature operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;If this proposal is funded, PI will actively recruit a minority or female student to conduct the proposed research. The graduate student supported by this grant will work with PI to integrate the research results obtained during the funding period into three demos for classroom teaching, labs for undergraduate and graduate students, high-school student summer camps, and annual campus recruitment events. The compact and portable far-infrared emitters to be implemented through the proposed research will ultimately make huge impacts on society based on several important applications outlined above.</AbstractNarration>
