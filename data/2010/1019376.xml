    <AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1019376 PI: Messersmith, Phillip ORG: Gordon Research Conferences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: 2010 Gordon Research Conference on Biointerface Science &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Biointerface Science involves the study and control of biomolecular interactions with surfaces. Biointerfacial phenomena are ubiquitous and critical features of biological systems as well as most cases where synthetic materials interface with biological systems. Despite the importance of biointerfacial phenomena in understanding biological systems, the field has only recently begun to attract attention as a unique interdisciplinary area of research. Biointerface Science is not merely a sub-discipline of Surface Science; it is rather a new discipline in its own right, owing to the unique nature of biological macromolecules and the pervasive influence of water. Compared to synthetic molecules, biomolecules are structurally larger, are often significantly more sophisticated in their structure and activity, and are extremely fragile. This places severe constraints on how they can be manipulated and studied. Biomolecules, especially proteins, readily adsorb, unfold and denature at surfaces, so that the utmost care must be taken in handling and studying them at surfaces. Likewise, approaches that have been developed to manipulate synthetic molecules at interfaces may fail for biomolecular interactions. In view of the unique properties of biomolecules and the increasing technological importance that they have assumed in practical applications where biomolecules meet surfaces, the goal of the Biointerface Science GRC is to provide a forum that enables dissemination of the latest advances in the field, in a setting that is conducive to participant interaction and discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: Like other GRCs, the Biointerface Science GRC seeks to bring together a diverse group of speakers that is comprised of widely acknowledged thought-leaders as well as young scientists who are notable for the novelty and quality of their work. Carefully selected, dynamic discussion leaders will provide insightful overview of the topic areas and orchestrate discussions that draw in the diverse group of attendees. A primary goal is to promote cross-disciplinary fertilization of new ideas in Biointerface Science. GRCs are typically held in a remote setting, and are a mixture of formal presentations, in-depth discussion and informal networking. They represent an ideal mechanism to bring together the chemists, physicists, biologists and bioengineers working in this area that would otherwise not intersect on the traditional conference circuit. The format promotes interaction of young scientists, underrepresented minority scientists, and junior faculty with prominent senior investigators in the field through the oral and poster sessions and through informal interactions such as social activities during the afternoon break and evening social hour. Eight women and minority speakers/discussion leaders are included in the preliminary program.</AbstractNarration>
