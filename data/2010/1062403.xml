    <AbstractNarration>The Department of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Stout will host an REU in mathematics where 8 students will attend an 8 week summer research program during each of the summers of 2012--2014. The research theme for the projects is the use of computational tools to address geometric questions in algebra and analysis. The program will involve students in research that addresses open questions in algebraic geometry, complex analysis and geometric group theory. Participants will be organized into two groups consisting of four students and two faculty mentors each, with a resident computer science faculty member providing theoretical and practical computer science support to both groups. The projects have been designed to allow students a strong chance to achieve results and partial results that are important to the current research of their faculty mentors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader objectives of this REU are, (1) to increase the participation in mathematics research by first-generation college students, (2) to motivate these students to pursue graduate education, (3) to prepare participants to succeed in graduate school. Many universities throughout the upper Midwest region where UW-Stout is located have large percentages of first-generation students, and at these schools we will specifically recruit qualified first-generation students who may not otherwise consider attending graduate school or an REU. We will prepare and motivate participants for graduate school through professional development seminars in skills necessary for success in graduate school as well as visits to industry and guest lectures that will expose the participants to a broad range of possible research careers. Additionally, research projects have been selected that introduce students to subjects and tools that they will encounter in graduate school but that they may not see in their undergraduate work. After the program ends, communication will be maintained with participants for the purposes of writing up and publishing results obtained, presenting results at national and regional conferences and for serving as resource mentors for the participants as they begin the next phases of their academic and professional careers.</AbstractNarration>
