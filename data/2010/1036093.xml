    <AbstractNarration>This grant will provide partial support for American graduate and postdoctoral students to participate in an international 2nd Graduate Summer Institute on Complex Plasmas, which will be held from August 4 to August 14, 2010 at the University of Greifswald in Greifswald, Germany. The stated goal is educational advancement of the scientific challenges and technological opportunities afforded by complex plasmas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer school will treat dusty and strongly coupled plasmas, reactive plasmas, microplasmas, quantum plasmas, and plasmas in contact with surfaces. This broad yet rigorous curriculum will lead to further advancement in this new and emerging field by attracting young American researchers in significant numbers since they will encounter scientific challenges as well as technological opportunities in these areas upon which they can build a successful academic or industrial careers. Further, the emerging complex plasma applications appear to be a remarkable fertile field for small, high-tech start-up companies which will perceive this field as a favorable innovation source for marketplace realization of basic plasma concepts.</AbstractNarration>
