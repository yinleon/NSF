    <AbstractNarration>This REU is an eight-week summer research experience in mathematics to be held at SUNY Potsdam for 14 undergraduates mathematics students (9 supported by the NSF site grant) working in groups of 3 or 4. The areas of the research for 2010 include Applied Graph Theory, Functional Analysis, Real Analysis and Topological Graph Theory. The student participants will be treated as colleagues by the faculty advisors as they jointly pursue unanswered mathematical questions. We have ambitious goals for our students. We would like to help them build their confidence in their ability to do research independently, and to help them build their appreciation and understanding of the vast field of mathematics. We also want to help them to improve their oral and written communication skills. Each group will present their results to the other students, at least twice during the eight weeks. Students will be encouraged to present their results at a national meeting. Each group will also use LaTex to prepare a paper on their work. We also hope to expand our students' mathematical horizons through hosting a weekly guest speaker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SUNY Potsdam is widely known for its undergraduate mathematics program, and Clarkson University has an international reputation in scientific research. Together, these institutions create for students a unique atmosphere of learning and research. &amp;#8232;&amp;#8232;We strongly encourage applications from women, minorities, students with disabilities, and other underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
