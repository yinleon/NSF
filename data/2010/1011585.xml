    <AbstractNarration>The formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current approximately 30 million years ago drastically changed the climate of Australia producing one of the largest arid biomes on earth. Studies have shown that the aridification of Australia has led to an increase in diversification rates in those organisms that adapted or were pre-adapted to the arid environment. This project aims to explore the climate-related diversification and biogeography of the Australian cicada genus Pauropsalta, which is distributed throughout all Australia's biomes and is thought to have originated during the major aridification events of Australia. 'Next generation' sequencing technology will be used to develop phylogenetic markers to aid in resolving evolutionary relationships among Pauropsalta species. In addition, ecological niche models will be estimated to distinguish the major lineages of Pauropsalta and reconstruct its ancestral biogeography. Incorporating niche models will provide a better understanding of how the aridification of Australia has affected the diversity of Australian biota.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in the training of three undergraduates in molecular techniques and phylogenetic methods and the further training of one graduate student (in 'next generation' sequencing technology). Each described cicada species will have a page devoted to it on the Encyclopedia of Life with specimen photos and distribution maps. This project will strengthen our international collaboration. Results will be presented at international meetings and submitted to peer-review journals.</AbstractNarration>
