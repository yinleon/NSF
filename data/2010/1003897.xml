    <AbstractNarration>Louisiana EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: EPS-1003897 &lt;br/&gt;Organization: Louisiana Board of Regents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LA-EPSCoR proposes to transform materials science research and education throughout the State of Louisiana by creating the Louisiana Alliance for Simulation-Guided Materials Applications (LA-SiGMA). The Alliance members are: Louisiana State University (LSU, lead institution), Grambling State University (Grambling), Louisiana Tech University (LA Tech), University of New Orleans (UNO), Southern University at Baton Rouge (SUBR), Tulane University (Tulane), and Xavier University (Xavier). Grambling, SUBR, and Xavier are Historically Black Colleges and Universities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;A major research focus of the Alliance is to develop common computational tools for the study of multiscale phenomena in three Science Driver areas of current strength in the State, and of substantial technological and economic importance: (1) correlated electronic materials, (2) energy materials, and (3) biomolecular materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LA-SiGMA project is organized to address common challenges and barriers (multiple length and time scales, multiple interactions, and correlations) by linking three Science Drivers (correlated electronic materials, energy materials, and biomolecular materials) of scientific and technological importance that leverage existing strengths in the State. Common computational tools focused on Monte-Carlo, Density Functional Theory, and Molecular Dynamics, are proposed to be developed and implemented on the next generation of high performance computing platforms. Experiments at existing facilities would test computational predictions and lead to refinement of formalisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The project would impact education and workforce development in the State by creating a comprehensive set of programs addressing various demographic needs. These efforts are proposed to result in major transformations in education, research, and workforce development in the State, as follows. Pipelines to advanced education would be created through joint programs such as the 4+1 program between Grambling and LA Tech for undergraduates to gain an Applied Physics MS degree in five years of study, the 3+2 dual degree program between Xavier and Tulane, and the 2+2 program between SUBR and Baton Rouge Community College. LA-EPSCoR also proposes to leverage a new inter-institutional PhD program in Materials Science (collaboration between LSU, SUBR, and UNO) and an interdisciplinary PhD in Molecular Sciences and Nanotechnology at LA Tech that will be proposed to the Louisiana Board of Regents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LA RII plans to provide specialized inter-institutional courses for graduate and postgraduate students. These courses will be integrated into the curricula of the PhD programs to ensure their sustainability. The graduate education program will be unique in the statewide delivery of new courses to support the degree programs using synchronous HD video as well as asynchronous methods.</AbstractNarration>
