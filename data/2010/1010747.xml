    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to hold a workshop on Building Systems. This workshop will address basic science needs for the understanding the dynamic behavior and the effective control of these complex systems. Buildings are the largest energy draw within the U.S. yet little is done to actively mitigate the energy use of those that are currently being designed and built. The objectives of the workshop are (1) to assess the current state of research and educational activities in the area of systems engineering and design, (2) to identify strategic research directions that could have a transformative impact on building systems, (3)to outline appropriate research themes and potential collaborators for interdisciplinary research, and (4) to develop an action plan for cultivating, promoting, and facilitating research and activities in building systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop's goals are in line with the grand challenge "restoring and improving urban infrastructure," outlined by the National Academy of Engineering for the 21st century. The workshop will stimulate and direct research that has high impact on areas of critical nationa need related to sustainability and energy efficiency.</AbstractNarration>
