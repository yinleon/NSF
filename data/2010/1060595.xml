    <AbstractNarration>The College of Notre Dame of Maryland's Pathways to Excellence Scholars program provides ten scholarships of up to $10,000 annually over a four-year period. Recipients are academically talented undergraduates with demonstrated financial need pursuing a Bachelor degree in mathematics, physics, computer information systems, or engineering. The program builds on successes learned from previously funded CSEMS programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Selected students are recruited from a pool of current and prospective students at the College of Notre Dame of Maryland's Women's College. The College has been cited as providing a female friendly environment for the study of physics. The College extends this female friendly environment to other disciplines using a tri-part mentoring system involving a faculty member in the student's discipline, a peer mentor from the program itself, and an external mentor from among a group of alumnae women professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholarship recipients are trained to deliver effective oral and poster presentations and present scholarly work both in and outside the College. Each student in the program constructs a career development plan with her faculty mentor and sets measurable annual goals. In addition, scholarship students participate in experiential learning opportunities in their fields of study.</AbstractNarration>
