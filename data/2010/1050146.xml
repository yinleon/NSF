    <AbstractNarration>Source controlled routing, where the edges of the network have some control over the paths taken by their packets, is a promising technique to improve network reliability and path quality. However, past studies of source-controlled routing algorithms have been based on overlay networks rather than via direct control of switches or routers---despite the performance-sensitive nature of these systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER project is studying adaptive multipath, source-routing algorithms to improve performance for real-time applications. The experiments use GENI Alpha, which provides a unique combination of coexistence with real traffic and deep programmability, which are essential to obtain accurate results in these experiments. Thus, the results of this project will develop novel, practical and experimentally-grounded techniques to improve reliability and path quality, and it will quantitatively demonstrate the value of experimenting on GENI infrastructure by comparing with overlay-based experiments. Results will be disseminated through publications, presentations, and demos of the software.</AbstractNarration>
