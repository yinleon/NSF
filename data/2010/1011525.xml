    <AbstractNarration>Genetically modified (GM) corn has been grown commercially since 1996 and now constitutes 80% of all corn grown in the United States. Although GM crops are cultivated widely, the environmental effects of this technology have not been thoroughly evaluated. Researchers at Portland State University are using genetically modified Bt corn to investigate how advances in plant biotechnology affect the important interactions between plants and symbiotic organisms in the soil environment. Transgenic Bt corn produces an insecticidal toxin that binds to soil particles and accumulates in the environment over time. Because soil microorganisms are critical for decomposing organic matter, recycling nutrients, and forming symbiotic relationships with plants, it is important to determine the effects of transgenic crop production in the soil. Healthy plant-microbe interactions are known to stimulate plant growth, enhance water and nutrient availability, and help plants survive drought, disease, and nutrient stress. Any disruption in this symbiotic relationship is likely to have negative effects on overall soil and plant health, requiring additional chemical inputs to maintain productivity in these systems. This dissertation research will examine whether symbiotic plant-fungal relationships are reduced in transgenic Bt corn under field conditions and assess the effects of Bt crop production on the abundance and diversity of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the soil ecosystem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although there are many benefits of using biotechnology in agriculture, such as reduced broad-spectrum pesticide use, little research has been done on the effects of transgenic crop production on symbiotic microorganisms in the soil. Examining non-target effects of GM crops on the soil community becomes even more important as transgenic crop acreage continues to increase globally. This research evaluates both the benefits and potential impacts of agricultural biotechnology on the soil environment with the goal of finding an acceptable balance between the use of genetically engineered crops and the preservation of a healthy soil ecosystem.</AbstractNarration>
