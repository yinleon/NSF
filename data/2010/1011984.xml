    <AbstractNarration>Data Protection laws that exempt data that is not individually &lt;br/&gt;identifiable have led to an explosion in anonymization research. &lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, how well current de-identification and anonymization &lt;br/&gt;techniques control risks to privacy and confidentiality is not well &lt;br/&gt;understood. Neither is the usefulness of anonymized data for real-world &lt;br/&gt;applications. The project addresses anonymization on three fronts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Textual data, even when explicit identifiers are removed (names, &lt;br/&gt;dates, locations), can contain highly identifiable information. For &lt;br/&gt;example, a sample of chief complaint fields from the Indiana Network &lt;br/&gt;for Patient Care (INPC) found several instances of "phantom limb &lt;br/&gt;pain". Amputees can be visually identifiable, but the HIPAA Safe &lt;br/&gt;Harbor rules do not list this as "identifying information". Any &lt;br/&gt;policy explicitly listing all types of identifying data is likely to &lt;br/&gt;fail. Through a joint effort with computer science and linguistics, &lt;br/&gt;the project is developing new methods to remove specific details from &lt;br/&gt;text while preserving meaning, eliminating such highly identifiable &lt;br/&gt;information without a priori knowledge of what would be identifying. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Current anonymization research is based on unproven measures of &lt;br/&gt;identifiability. Through a re-identification challenge on synthetic &lt;br/&gt;data (but based on real healthcare data), the project is evaluating &lt;br/&gt;the efficacy of these measures. Interdisciplinary teams of students &lt;br/&gt;are given challenge problems - anonymized data with hypothetical &lt;br/&gt;healthcare data - and asked to make (hypothetical) inferences about &lt;br/&gt;health information of individuals. The results can be used to &lt;br/&gt;calibrate the effectiveness of different anonymization measures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) The utility of anonymized data has been a concern among research: &lt;br/&gt;Does anonymized data provide credible research results? By partnering &lt;br/&gt;with healthcare studies at the Kinsey Institute and Purdue University &lt;br/&gt;School of Nursing, the project is comparing analyses on original data &lt;br/&gt;with analyses on anonymized data, and evaluating the impact of types &lt;br/&gt;of anonymization on research results. A related issue is determining &lt;br/&gt;the impact on data collection: Are individuals more candid in their &lt;br/&gt;responses if they know data will be anonymized? Outcomes are broadening &lt;br/&gt;the scope of research that can be performed on anonymized data, while &lt;br/&gt;ensuring that researchers know when access to individually identifiable &lt;br/&gt;data (with attendant restrictions and safeguards) is needed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through these tasks, the project is advancing our ability to utilize &lt;br/&gt;the wealth of data we now collect for the benefit of society, while &lt;br/&gt;ensuring individual privacy is protected. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web site at the URL: &lt;br/&gt;http://projects.cerias.purdue.edu/TextAnon</AbstractNarration>
