    <AbstractNarration>1051797&lt;br/&gt;Tan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a planning visit to enable Professor Sheldon Tan at the University of California, Riverside to meet with Professor Hao Yu at the School of Electric and Electronic Engineering at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore. They plan to undertake research on design and verification of 60Ghz RF/MM integrated circuits. They will be collaborating on nanometer VLSI design techniques and would like to broader the joint research efforts and to have a more substantial and long-term research partnership. The researchers plan to develop computer-aided design algorithms for modeling, simulation and design methods for high-frequency integrated circuits, which is one of the grand challenges confronting the design automation and semiconductor industries. In addition, new research areas such as design techniques for emerging non-silicon nano-circuit and nano-architectures, and on-chip power regulation techniques will be explored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is sufficient overlap of interests between researchers in the U.S. and Singapore to indicate that they can successfully pursue the activities proposed, and that the interaction will benefit both sides. Professor Hao Yu is a leading expert in the simulation and modeling of high-frequency integrated circuits such as radio-frequency, microwave and millimeter integrated circuits. Professor Tan is a recognized expert on modeling and simulation for interconnects. In addition, the involvement of two U.S. graduate students will enable them to gain a valuable international perspective and insight. They will also participate in discussions on future collaborative activities with the researchers. The University of California, Riverside is an accredited Hispanic Serving Institution and has an excellent record of attracting and graduating underrepresented minorities, which means that their education efforts will directly contribute to the diversity in the U.S. technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>
