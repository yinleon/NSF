    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is the objective of this work to develop a computational framework for multi-rate/multi-scale modeling and simulation of power electronics and energy conversion systems for hardware-in-the-loop testing on multi-domain simulation platforms. Based on high-fidelity models of components and subsystems of power and energy systems, numerically rigorous, order-reduction techniques are used to extract several levels of interconnected simulation resolutions from the high-order detailed model. The resulting multi-resolution simulation offers rapid and accurate simulation of the overall systems from a general to a detailed consideration. The computational prototyping framework for switched linear systems, nonlinear systems, and systems with controllers is to be developed. Thereafter, the framework will be extended to ?systems of systems? and other concepts, like flexible nested simulation and co-simulations. At each stage, the numerical reduction techniques and corresponding flexible framework are to be validated with several hardware prototypes of power electronics and energy conversion systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed methodology addresses the tradeoff between the modeling and simulation accuracy and speed. The accuracy is provided through high-fidelity component models and physics-based approaches. The simulation speed and stability is ensured by numerically rigorous order reduction techniques. The resolution of the simulation environment is adjusted arbitrarily upon user discretion, and the signal integrity is preserved. Moreover, since this approach is systematic and automatable, there is less need for expert knowledge. From a control perspective, it provides a framework to implement hardware in the loop and real-time controller concepts. Moreover, the framework comprises a multi-domain simulation environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of this computational prototyping framework will allow aggregated and aggressive design, analysis, and optimization approaches in power and energy systems, in particular large solar systems, wind farms, advanced electric ship, and hybrid vehicles. This will help accelerate these technologies to adoption, creating energy saving and positive impacts on environment, sustainability, and geopolitics. For educational outreach, undergraduates from different engineering disciplines are to be employed. The recruitment strategy will target underrepresented groups in particular. The team will promote education as an integrated part of this project and will publish the educational aspects of this project. The material will also be used in an advanced power electronics course. Furthermore, a monograph will be published on the developed techniques and will be shared freely via the internet</AbstractNarration>
