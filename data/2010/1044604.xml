    <AbstractNarration>This Research and Training Group (RTG) award for the Logic group at Caltech/UC-Irvine/UCLA supports a variety of initiatives designed to increase the number of US citizens and permanent residents who pursue careers in mathematical logic and mathematics as a whole, and to tighten the connection between training, studies, research, and professional skills. Specific initiatives supported by the award include: recruitment and training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in mathematical logic; better preparation of these students and postdocs for their future careers through inter-campus meetings that concentrate on professional development; undergraduate summer schools in mathematical logic with the multiple aims of drawing students to the subject nationwide, preparing them for graduate school, connecting them with graduate students, and improving the teaching, mentoring, and leadership skills of graduate student assistants in the schools; graduate summer schools, again aimed at students nationwide, with the aim of bridging studies and research for graduate student participants, connecting them with postdoctoral scholars, and preparing the postdoctoral scholars who assist in the school for mentoring and leadership in their future careers; summer session courses for transfer students from community colleges, to help them bridge the gap between&lt;br/&gt;lower- and upper-division courses; enrichment lectures and activities for middle school girls, high school students, and undergraduate students including in community colleges, exposing them to the many creative aspects of mathematics, with the aim of drawing them to further studies in the subject; and an online library of videotaped talks available for downloading, in mathematical logic at levels ranging from general audience to graduate seminar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These initiatives will enhance training, increase participation, and increase the visibility of mathematical logic and mathematics as a whole, at a wide spectrum of training stages, both locally and nationally.</AbstractNarration>
