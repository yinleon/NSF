    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;Stressors such as plant pathogens (bacteria, fungi and viruses) cause enormous losses of food crops. Understanding the mechanisms by which plants respond to such stressors and develop immunity is critical to reducing such losses. Calcium, a key signaling molecule in all eukaryotes, has been implicated in plant immunity for decades, and numerous studies have revealed rapid and temporary changes in cellular calcium levels in response to pathogen attacks. However, how calcium regulates pathways involved in plant immunity is poorly understood. This project concerns a small family of transcription factors that are regulated by calcium; these factors were first discovered in plants and then in animals. One of these factors, named SR1, is a negative regulator of plant immunity. SR1 interacts with two other transcription factors. The goal of this project is to use genetic, cell biological, biochemical, molecular, and bioinformatics tools to study the biological roles of SR1-interacting proteins in plant immunity. Single and double mutants of SR1-interacting transcription factors will be used to analyze plant defense responses, the roles and functional significance of various conserved domains in SR1 will be studied, and global identification of targets of SR1 and its interacting transcription factors will be implemented. Overall, this project will contribute to understanding the functions of a calcium-regulated transcription factor in plant immunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The knowledge obtained from this project will be relevant to agriculturally important plants as the calcium-modulated transcription factors are highly conserved in crop plants; a better understanding of the function of SR1 and its interacting proteins will have potential applications in reducing the food crop spoilage that results from infection with plant pathogens. This project will integrate research and teaching by training high school students, undergraduate students, a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher in various aspects of genetics, bioinformatics, cell and molecular biology and by encouraging their participation in national scientific meetings.</AbstractNarration>
