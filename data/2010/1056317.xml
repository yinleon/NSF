    <AbstractNarration>Small amplitude slow slip events were discovered at both the updip and downdip limits of the subduction zones where tsunami-generating mega earthquakes occur. Understanding the physics of these events may provide constraints on stress transfer and loading that potentially lead to great earthquakes. The proposed study will focus on investigating the possible mechanisms for generating very low frequency earthquakes (VLFEs) detected in the Nankai accretionary prism. The mechanisms that trigger these un-earthquake like seismic signals are controversial. The project involves an experimental investigation on the failure mechanisms related to pore pressure excess, which is widely cited for triggering slip that induces VLFEs. Using an integrated approach consists of deformation and frictional experiments, microstructural analyses, and numerical modeling on slip and failure associated with the observed seismic events, the project's goal is to gain better understanding of the fundamental mechanics of shallow VLFEs. &lt;br/&gt;The multidisciplinary and hands-on nature of experimental studies is a great platform to motivate open-minded young students, especially from underrepresented groups, to pursue careers in science and engineering. The proposed work includes building a virtual deformation laboratory where students everywhere can learn about rock deformation. The experimental results will provide new insights into seismicity at subduction zones.</AbstractNarration>
