    <AbstractNarration>Logic solvers are software programs that can solve complex logical&lt;br/&gt;formulas fully automatically. Problems in many areas of Computer&lt;br/&gt;Science, such as artificial intelligence, program analysis, security,&lt;br/&gt;hardware verification, and cyber-physical systems can be faithfully&lt;br/&gt;translated into logical formulas. Those formulas can then be solved&lt;br/&gt;fully automatically by logic solvers. Over the past two decades, at&lt;br/&gt;least ten different logic-solving communities have emerged, based on&lt;br/&gt;different logical languages and solving techniques. These communities&lt;br/&gt;have independently been building computing infrastructure to aid&lt;br/&gt;development and evaluation of their solvers: libraries of benchmark&lt;br/&gt;formulas, cluster-backed web services, annual competitions, and more.&lt;br/&gt;Such infrastructure also provides an important access point for&lt;br/&gt;users, who can find all the solvers at one site, or even run solvers&lt;br/&gt;on the infrastructure cluster to test their relative capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to build a single piece of shared&lt;br/&gt;computing infrastructure called StarExec, which will be used by many&lt;br/&gt;different logic solving communities. StarExec will provide improved&lt;br/&gt;services for established logic-solving communities, and lower the&lt;br/&gt;entry barrier for new and emerging communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The StarExec infrastructure will consist of a custom web service&lt;br/&gt;interfacing to a medium-sized compute cluster. This open-source&lt;br/&gt;service will allow multiple logic-solving communities to host&lt;br/&gt;benchmark libraries, run jobs comparing different solvers, and host&lt;br/&gt;competitions. StarExec will leverage economies of scale to provide&lt;br/&gt;more sophisticated services than is feasible for most individual&lt;br/&gt;logic-solving communities. A very important goal of StarExec is not&lt;br/&gt;just to collocate different logic-solving communities, but to unite&lt;br/&gt;them. To this end, the StarExec team will develop formal&lt;br/&gt;specifications of both the syntax and proof-theoretic semantics of&lt;br/&gt;different communities' logical languages. This will be done using a&lt;br/&gt;meta-language called LFSC ("Logical Framework with Side Conditions"),&lt;br/&gt;developed in previous NSF-funded research. Translation of formulas&lt;br/&gt;between compatible fragments of different logics will be implemented,&lt;br/&gt;which will will enable a greater degree of integration between solver&lt;br/&gt;communities than was previously possible. For example, it will be&lt;br/&gt;possible for solvers in one community to be run on benchmarks from&lt;br/&gt;another. This integration will also aid users of logic solvers, who&lt;br/&gt;will have a greater variety of options, all in a common framework, for&lt;br/&gt;solving their problems. The broader impact of the StarExec project&lt;br/&gt;will be to accelerate the development, adoption, and convergence of&lt;br/&gt;different logic-solving technologies. This will enable faster&lt;br/&gt;progress in nationally important application areas such as artificial&lt;br/&gt;intelligence, verification, security, and cyber-physical systems,&lt;br/&gt;which increasingly depend on high-performance logic solvers.</AbstractNarration>
