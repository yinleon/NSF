    <AbstractNarration>Professor Aaron L. Odom of Michigan State University is supported by the Chemical Catalysis (CAT) Program in the Division of Chemistry to explore the properties and reactivity of titanium complexes with a focus on new reactions for the catalytic production of heterocyclic compounds. The main focus will be on the hydroamination of alkynes and alkenes, which are atom-economical synthetic methodologies for the generation of C?N bonds. Multi-component coupling reactions that yield complex organic compounds in a single synthetic step as well as routes to surface-tethered catalyst systems for multicomponent coupling chemistry will be investigated. The advantages of titanium-based chemistry include titanium?s high natural abundance and lack of toxicity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of new atom-economical reaction chemistry and catalysts for C?N bond formation is critical for the efficient, green synthesis of a variety of nitrogen-based heterocycles. These nitrogen heterocycles have applications in many areas that impact our daily lives. For example, around 80% of the pharmaceuticals on the market contain nitrogen, many in the form of nitrogen heterocycles. This research is expected to have an immediate impact on the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industry. Graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral associates involved in this research will receive excellent training in chemical catalysis and synthetic chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
