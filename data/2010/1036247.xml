    <AbstractNarration>Shaw University's Targeted Infusion project entitled: Develop a 3D Immersive Online Environment, has the goal to increase the number of STEM majors by targeting entering freshman taking the University required Freshman Studies course, and to retain existing STEM students through the establishment of academic and social support networks. The project will infuse the Freshman Studies courses with a new technology- the creation of a 3D online virtual world in which students will be exposed to topics in science and technology as well as careers in STEM. This project will be an avenue in which all students entering Shaw University will be exposed to STEM disciplines. The anticipated outcomes from this project include the development of a technology rich curriculum, an increase in the number of students choosing a STEM discipline, an increase in the retention rate of STEM students, students that are better prepared to enter graduate and professional school, and students who are more informed about careers in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;An online format such as a "virtual world" allows students to visit places they may not have the opportunity to do so otherwise. They will be able to experience and see what scientists in various fields do without leaving their homes or classroom. In a virtual world, through their Avatars, students are not merely observers but participants. They will be able to walk into a lab and conduct experiments. The use of a gaming format provides a means to make learning fun and engaging. During the Freshman Studies course, all students will work in teams, fostering cooperative learning. STEM students will then be organized into cohorts during the freshman year providing students with social and academic networks, crucial in the adjustment to college from high school. This project will provide a blueprint for the implementation of a cost-effective and technology rich environment that can be used to recruit and retain STEM majors.</AbstractNarration>
