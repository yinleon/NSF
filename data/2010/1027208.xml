    <AbstractNarration>This project will develop a new magnetic field model aimed for use during magnetospheric substorms. The model will be derived from a series of computer experiments based on the equilibrium version of the Rice Convection Model (RCM-E). The project will construct a cross-tail current module for the substorm growth phase and a substorm current-wedge module for the expansion. The project will also use the comprehensive set of RCM-E simulations as a large database to systematically investigate the adiabatic convection of the plasma during substorm growth phase and the transport of the depleted flux tubes in the expansion phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methodology to be used is to generate a large number of RCM-E simulations with systematically varied inputs. This will make it possible to determine how different changes in the boundary conditions and the initial condition affect the magnetic field configuration in the inner magnetosphere. This approach will also make it possible to establish the cause-and-effect relationships between different physical processes and consequences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new model will be made available to the space physics community where it can be used to specify the magnetic field configuration for a variety of substorm conditions. The project will benefit several of the Focus Groups that are part of the Geospace Environment Modeling program. The model is expected to be of utility in understanding and improving space weather forecasts as well.</AbstractNarration>
