    <AbstractNarration>This U.S.-Chile award will support an international workshop on Complex Analysis and Mathematical Physics to be held prior to the first-ever joint American Mathematical Society-Chilean Mathematical Society Meeting in Pucon, Chile that will take place in December, 2010. The workshop will be organized jointly by a group of scientists at the University of Bio-Bio (UBB) in Chile, the Mathematical Institute at the University of Bergen, Norway (UiB) and at the University of South Florida (USF). This workshop will create new exciting opportunities for collaboration between these scientific communities and strengthen the Chile-US joint enterprise in Mathematics and Physics. One of the new directions of research receiving considerable attention in South-American mathematical communities is the complex analysis and mathematical physics of two-dimensional phenomena, known as elliptic or Laplacian growth (or, Hele-Shaw flows). This elegant scientific field has recently found surprisingly many applications, which makes it interesting both for established researchers and their younger colleagues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will provide an opportunity to develop new collaborations between mathematicians and physicists, Europeans and South and North Americans, young and experienced. In particular, the NSF funds will be used to bring a diverse group of young US researchers and graduate students into collaboration with South American colleagues. Two of the committee members are women who are visibly active, not only as researchers, but also as mentors who attract young women into mathematics. This will help to attract a significant number of women and minorities to participate in the workshop and will initiate their infusion into a larger group of scientists working in these areas. This project is supported by the Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Analysis Program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
