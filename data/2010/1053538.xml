    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is for travel support for the participation of two United States Scientists/Artists, Victoria Vesna and Leah Buechley, in the 2010 ACM Multimedia Conference Interactive Art Program Exhibition "An Interactive Renaissance of Color" to be held in Florence, Italy. Dr. Vesna's work is characterized by her utilization of scientific practice as source material. The result is to educate the public to understand new discoveries, and provoke thought about their impact on society. Dr. Buechley describes her work as high-low tech, because it is part of the do-it-yourself movement of citizen science and engineering. Both of these Scientists/Artists inspire to broaden participation in computing. Vesna's impact is pronounced particularly through her collaborations with life scientists and physicists. She develops a functional model, harnessing artistic practice as a means for communicating about science, and scientific practice as grist for art. Buechley provocatively combines circuitry, fashion, and design, challenging gender stereotypes about geeks, and thus inviting the participation of a new generation of young women into STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific tracks of the ACM Multimedia conference focus on algorithmic techniques and scientific measurements, emphasizing content recognition and streaming media. The Interactive Art track develops creative and expressive innovative use contexts that stretch our imagination of what is possible for multimedia science and technology. This track serves to advance the dialog of artists and scientists in order to advance the principles and uses of computing. These connections, in the historically rich environment of Florence, Italy where art and science where strong collaborators, will be used as a springboard to catalyze new ideas that will inspire the future of multimedia computing as an example of how artistic and scientific research can be combined in the most innovative, dynamic, thought-provoking ways imaginable.</AbstractNarration>
