    <AbstractNarration>The project provides travel support for applied and computational mathematicians from the US to attend a set of seven coordinated workshops taking place at the University of British Columbia (UBC), each for 2-4 days within the period July 13-16, 2011. Collectively this set of workshops form the conference Applied Mathematics Perspectives 2011. This is a satellite conference to the 7th International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM 2011), which also takes place in Vancouver the following week. The seven workshops cover various topics related to mathematical modeling using differential equations and scientific computing, and are organized by experts in each field. They have been selected from a larger set of workshops by a PIMS/MITACS panel to receive partial support from those organizations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; All of the workshops address subjects that are currently of great research interest and are directly related to themes of ICIAM, as well as to NSF priority areas. Examples include medical and seismic imaging, the development of tools to increase the reproducibility of research in computational science, and the study of fluid dynamics of substances that are difficult to model, such as landslides or industrial fluids or grains. A special effort is made to involve students, postdoctoral fellows, women, and under-represented minorities from mathematics and computer science departments throughout the US. Funding primarily is used for young researchers and other participants who do not have other sources of funding to attend these workshops. This also facilitates their participation in the ICIAM conference, a major international conference the following week that attracts roughly 3000 participants from around the world. The workshops all take place on the campus of UBC, and benefit from unified organization and the opportunity for interaction between participants. This creates an aggregate workshop that is larger than any of the individual workshops, with several tracks of talks and a common poster session. On the other hand, it is more focused, intimate, and informal than the ICIAM conference and provides additional networking opportunities, particularly for young researchers.</AbstractNarration>
