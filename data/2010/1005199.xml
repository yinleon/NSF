    <AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site is for a nine-week summer program at Colorado State University. The Site pertains to the scientific study of mind and brain within the fields of perception, cognition, perceptual neuroscience, and cognitive neuroscience. Participants attain specialized training and research experience in one of two topic areas of their choosing: human learning and memory, or human visual perception and cognition. Ten students will be selected from across the country, focusing on undergraduates from minority serving institutions and non-Ph.D. granting institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The centerpiece of the program is an intensive research experience in which each participant develops, runs, and analyzes her or his own experiment under the mentorship of a faculty member who specializes in the study of human learning and memory or visual perception and cognition using behavioral and/or neuroscientific approaches. Participants will also &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(a) attend a weekly, thematic research seminar within the topic area of their choosing, with participating faculty alternating in presenting and leading the discussion of methods, issues, and findings from their own area of inquiry; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(b) attend an additional weekly seminar that covers topics pertaining to research ethics and professional development;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(c) participate in workshops on the use of the staffs state-of the-art equipment (driving simulator, EEG equipment, eyetracker, etc.); &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(d) participate in additional workshops on experiment construction and data analysis using E-Prime and SPSS; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(e) go on a site visit to the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center to learn about fMRI and MEG methods; and &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(f) optionally complete a sophomore-level course entitled Mind, Brain, &amp; Behavior, either as a guest or for course credit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a capstone experience, students will present their work in poster format during a research symposium held at the end of the nine-week session. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: A central goal of the program is to stimulate interest in the science of mind and brain by integrating research and education, and by providing knowledge, skills, and experiences that are rare at the undergraduate level. In doing so, the program enhances participants' prospects for pursuing graduate study and careers in science, especially for those participants who do not have comparable opportunities at their home institution.</AbstractNarration>
