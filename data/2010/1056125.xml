    <AbstractNarration>Questions of neural synchrony -- correlations in cell-to-cell spiking -- have &lt;br/&gt;driven decades of research. However, recent technological and theoretical &lt;br/&gt;advances have thrust open two lines of inquiry. The first is understanding &lt;br/&gt;the combinatorial scale of the correlations that occur in natural and model &lt;br/&gt;neural networks. It is well known that describing neural activity requires &lt;br/&gt;pairwise statistical interactions -- but we do not yet understand when network &lt;br/&gt;dynamics produce patterns of correlations that extend beyond this pairwise &lt;br/&gt;description, when the pairwise descriptions will be complete, and what the &lt;br/&gt;overall implications are for neural coding and signal processing. &lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator will address these questions for a set of "canonical" &lt;br/&gt;neural circuits, or motifs, and will build toward networks of gradually &lt;br/&gt;increasing complexity in their dynamics and architecture. Further, extending &lt;br/&gt;beyond intrinsic network dynamics, he will ask how these basic network properties &lt;br/&gt;determine the ways in which patterns of synchrony can be controlled by external stimulation. &lt;br/&gt;Answering these complementary questions requires synergies between methods of &lt;br/&gt;stochastic processes, dynamical systems, and statistical inference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do how networked neurons work together to produce the brain's astonishing &lt;br/&gt;computational ability? Such coordinated neural dynamics are characterized by &lt;br/&gt;synchrony among different neurons. One prospect is that this coordinated &lt;br/&gt;activity opens new channels for signal processing: there is a combinatorial &lt;br/&gt;explosion in the number of possible multi-neuron patterns that can occur in &lt;br/&gt;increasingly large networks. However, we only have the first hints at whether &lt;br/&gt;and when these patterns systematically occur in the brain's networks, and what &lt;br/&gt;information they might (or might not) carry. Shea-Brown will study the &lt;br/&gt;fundamental properties of neural dynamics, connectivity, and noise that &lt;br/&gt;determine the level and impact of multi-neuron synchrony in a series of &lt;br/&gt;networks of gradually increasing complexity. He will use &lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary tools from both deterministic and statistical branches of &lt;br/&gt;applied mathematics to understand how levels of synchrony are created, &lt;br/&gt;destroyed, and manipulated by external stimulation. These findings will &lt;br/&gt;contribute to experimental and clinical neuroscience: working in &lt;br/&gt;collaboration with experimentalists, the investigator will make predictions for light stimuli &lt;br/&gt;that evoke higher-order correlations in the retina, and for electrical stimuli &lt;br/&gt;that suppress pathological synchrony in neurodegenerative disease. These &lt;br/&gt;questions, as part of theoretical neuroscience -- an emerging field that is &lt;br/&gt;rich in open questions and highly varied interdisciplinary techniques -- &lt;br/&gt;present a strong opportunity for recruiting, engaging, and training &lt;br/&gt;undergraduates in the mathematical sciences. Shea-Brown will direct this opportunity &lt;br/&gt;toward the underrepresented groups from which new scholars are most urgently &lt;br/&gt;needed, through an integrated four-year research pathway for undergraduates. &lt;br/&gt;This will be developed together with newly designed units in the computational &lt;br/&gt;science and mathematical biology courses taught by the investigator.</AbstractNarration>
