    <AbstractNarration>Objectives and approaches&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to design and demonstrate efficient, ultrasmall III-V semiconductor light sources based on nonlinear frequency conversion. The approach is to use high quality factor photonic crystal resonators to (1) provide phase matching, which is impossible in unprocessed III-V semiconductors, and to (2) greatly reduce the device footprint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals of this research are to demonstrate: Highly efficient second harmonic generation in photonic crystal structures; Photonic-crystal based devices for sum frequency and difference frequency generation; Enhanced spontaneous parametric down conversion and two photon emission. The proposed devices could serve as ultrasmall, ultralow power, on-chip light sources for wavelengths from visible through mid-infrared. The proposed research could also enhance the extremely low efficiency processes of spontaneous parametric down conversion and two photon emission, which can serve as sources of entangled photons for quantum information experiments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts &lt;br/&gt;The proposed experiments open a new approach to study nonlinear optical effects using semiconductor nanostructures and would have a significant impact on the nanophotonics and nonlinear optics communities. Moreover, the same platform could be employed for sensing and spectroscopy of biological and chemical molecules, as well as for quantum information experiments with entangled photons. The project will include educational and outreach activities integrated with research, which the PI has already initiated, including active recruitment of minorities and women for science and engineering careers, development of new classes and textbook, undergraduate research and advising, and participation in outreach programs for high-school students and teachers.</AbstractNarration>
