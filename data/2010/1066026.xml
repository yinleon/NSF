    <AbstractNarration>PI: Dauenhauer, Paul and W. James Pfaendtner &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Massachusetts and University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Numbers: 1065810 and 1066026&lt;br/&gt;Title: COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: Pyrolysis of Cellulose Intermediate Liquids: Automated Mechanism Development and Experimental Characterization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work focuses on addressing fundamental obstacles in the development of sustainable biorefineries that employ large-scale biomass pyrolysis for fuels and chemicals. Biomass pyrolysis is an attractive means for intensification of stored energy in woody biomass. Knowledge is lacking on how to employ this technology on an industrial scale. A collaborative research team consisting of Dr. Paul Dauenhauer (UMass) and Dr. Jim Pfaendtner (UW) will use a unified theoretical and experimental approach to create and harness complex reaction networks that mechanistically describe the key pyrolysis steps in converting cellulose to useful fuel. This EAGER grant is for the first phase of the project to conduct preliminary experimental studies related to the reactor design and characterization. Preliminary modeling studies will also be performed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will proceed according to two objectives that systematically address the hypotheses related to the importance of understanding intermediate physical phases in cellulose pyrolysis. Objective one will provide support to construct an experimental apparatus to provide a well-controlled experimental environment for studying intermediate cellulose liquid phases. Preliminary experimental studies will be performed using levoglucosan as a model component of cellulose. The second objective will use the results from the experimental effort to perform preliminary studies in automated mechanism generation of levoglucosan pyrolysis. The automated mechanism generation framework will be adapted to cellulose chemistry and used to identify future research priorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This work will develop a systematic approach synthesizing experiments and theory for the development of biomass pyrolysis models. These models are essential for the design and scaleup of biorefineries and to provide quantitative information on the overall process economics and environmental impact of biomass pyrolysis. This work has significant potential for helping the US move toward sustainable energy independence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The PI from UW will involve a summer REU student in performing some of the preliminary simulations. Additionally, a plan for development of the key findings of this research into a senior undergraduate course on reaction engineering is planned. Finally, any published final models resulting from the research will be made available to the general public and other research groups.</AbstractNarration>
