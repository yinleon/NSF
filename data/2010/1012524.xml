    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Andrew J. Gellman (Carnegie Mellon University), E. Charles H. Sykes (Tufts University) and David S. Sholl (Georgia Institute of Technology) will collaborate to develop and apply methods for high throughput study of structure sensitive surface chemistry. The core of the experimental program is the preparation, characterization and study of curved single crystal metal surfaces that expose continuous distributions of surface orientations; i.e. regions of the surface that expose different step and kink densities. Spatially resolved experimental tools such as STM, XPS, and LEIS will be used to characterize the local structures of these surfaces and to measure surface reaction kinetics at each point. This effort will resolve the role of step and kink density in several surface reactions. Complementary computational modeling tools will be used to understand the role of surface orientation in surface reaction kinetics. These methods will greatly accelerate the study of structure sensitive surface chemistry. The impact of this work will be development of a fundamental understanding of several catalytically important surface reactions. The broader impact will include outreach to high school students, exposure of undergraduates to research and the development of short videos on surface science and nanoscience for public viewing.</AbstractNarration>
