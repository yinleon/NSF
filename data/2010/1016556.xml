    <AbstractNarration>Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are an&lt;br/&gt;essential ingredient in many areas of Sciences and Engineering. Often&lt;br/&gt;in the applications of PDEs, one has to deal with additional&lt;br/&gt;difficulties caused by the singularities in the geometry, the&lt;br/&gt;coefficients, or the boundary conditions. The main goals of this&lt;br/&gt;proposal are to obtain more efficient numerical methods for equations&lt;br/&gt;with singular solutions and to develop user friendly implementations.&lt;br/&gt;The PI and his collaborators will design improved meshes that provide&lt;br/&gt;optimal rates of convergence for the Finite Element Method in three&lt;br/&gt;dimensions for elliptic equations on polyhedral domains with&lt;br/&gt;non-smooth interfaces. These equations form one of the basic&lt;br/&gt;ingredients in many other applications. The results will be extended&lt;br/&gt;to quasi-linear elliptic equations and to evolution equations. For&lt;br/&gt;some of these equations, spaces with higher smoothness or other additional&lt;br/&gt;properties are sometimes needed, and the Generalized Finite Element&lt;br/&gt;Method will be used for these purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal will contribute to the formation of graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students by advising and mentoring them and by&lt;br/&gt;integrating them in research projects. The PI also plans to continue&lt;br/&gt;to run an Interdisciplinary Seminar featuring outside speakers,&lt;br/&gt;including non-mathematicians. The proposed research will lead to the&lt;br/&gt;design and testing of new and improved numerical methods for Partial&lt;br/&gt;Differential Equations (PDEs) of interest in Sciences and&lt;br/&gt;Engineering. The resulting numerical methods will be presented and&lt;br/&gt;implemented in a way that makes them accessible to&lt;br/&gt;non-mathematicians. It will also contribute to applying mathematical&lt;br/&gt;results in practice by interaction with researchers from other fields,&lt;br/&gt;including the private sector. It will also contribute to the creation&lt;br/&gt;of specialists able to use advanced theoretical tools to handle&lt;br/&gt;practical problems. He will also introduce numerical methods and the&lt;br/&gt;use of computers in more traditional undergraduate courses. The PI&lt;br/&gt;also plans to popularize mathematical questions that arise from&lt;br/&gt;practice among mathematicians. The theoretical results and the&lt;br/&gt;resulting numerical methods will have applications in Mathematical&lt;br/&gt;Physics, Quantum Chemistry, Biology, Finance (Risk Management and&lt;br/&gt;pricing of Financial Derivatives, or Options), and other areas.</AbstractNarration>
