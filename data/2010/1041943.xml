    <AbstractNarration>Professor Paul Weiss and his coworkers in the Department of Chemistry at the Pennsylvania State University are using a number of scanning probe microscopic methods to examine various aspects of single molecule electronics. With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Weiss and coworkers are addressing questions of molecule orientation, photoactivation, molecular conductivity, and molecular switching in self-assembled monolayer model systems. Measurements are made with scanning probe methods developed in the Weiss laboratory. Fundamental information from these studies is useful for developing design considerations and materials choices for molecular electronic devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to realize the promise of molecular electronic devices, fundamental information about molecule conductivity, switching behavior, photoactivation, and stability is needed. Professor Weiss and his coworkers in the Department of Chemistry at the Pennsylvania State University are using scanning probe microscopy studies of molecules embedded in self-assembled monolayer model systems to obtain this sort of information. Material and interfacial properties of these model systems are determined, providing fundamental information for device design.</AbstractNarration>
