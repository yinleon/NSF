    <AbstractNarration>The overall goal of this proposal is to develop an integrated research and educational plan focused on cellular migration. This award, supported by the CBET division of the National Science Foundation, will enable the development of novel tools to uncover the mechanisms governing endothelial cell chemotaxis. Research and education will be integrated through their common focus on cell-extracellular matrix interactions. The research goal of this proposal is to use an approach inspired by directed evolution to study chemotaxis. The natural cell-to-cell variations and heterogeneities within a population will be exploited to uncover basic mechanisms that drive efficient chemotaxis in endothelial cells in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). A novel chemotactic device will be developed which sorts endothelial cells based on the robustness of their response to chemotactic gradients of VEGF. These sub-populations will be analyzed for underlying molecular differences that are contributing to the differential chemotactic behaviors. Experiments will be performed in both 2D and 3D microenvironments and compared. This work has the potential to uncover critical insights into the molecular regulation of endothelial cell chemotaxis. Moreover, it has clear implications in the field of tissue engineering, where controlled, directed endothelial cell migration could enable the engineering of vascular networks in tissue engineered scaffolds, and in cancer research, where a better understanding of angiogenesis could enable the development of more targeted therapeutics to prevent endothelial cell chemotactic response. The broader impact of this CAREER program is the development of an interdisciplinary learning environment that connects biology and engineering across multiple length scales (molecular, cellular and tissue level). Innovative teaching methodologies and outreach activities will be employed to introduce middle and high school girls in the local, underserved, rural community to concepts in biology and engineering in a tractable way and to promote lifelong learning in science.</AbstractNarration>
