    <AbstractNarration>This proposal will fund the REU program associated with the Keck Northeast Astronomy Consortium (KNAC). KNAC is a group of eight liberal arts colleges with astronomy programs that have collaborated since 1990. The consortium was formed to enhance the research opportunities for undergraduates at institutions where astronomy was taught, but where research opportunities are limited. Ten undergraduates per year take part in the summer research program that runs for ten weeks. Some (2-4) of the program slots are reserved for students from outside the consortium. Near the end of the program each supported students participate in a Student Symposium that is attended by the entire faculty in the consortium. The students give a 10-min talk on their research and produce poster presentations. Additionally the students write a 4-page paper on their projects and submit it to the Proceedings of the Undergraduate Research Symposium which is distributed throughout the astronomy community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The very nature of an REU site results in a broader impact, in terms of educational activities. In this case the consortium works as a model for other small colleges to show how a regional partnership can overcome issues of size. Since 1990 just over 50% of the student participants have been female. The consortium members pledge to continue their efforts to attract more members of underrepresented groups to the program. The member schools also recruit participants from schools in the northeast where there are no opportunities for astronomy research.</AbstractNarration>
