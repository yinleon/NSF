    <AbstractNarration>1033615&lt;br/&gt;Rockett&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will develop an advanced numerical modeling program for simulation of solar photovoltaic (PV) devices that relies on a new stochastic approach to accurately depict the real device environment. The model will also enable the realistic prediction of device performance for novel PV structures. This functionality will allow the solar PV research community to better assess the merits of new device concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed modeling activities are designed to make fundamental improvements in the way solar PV devices are currently simulated. Existing models explicitly and simultaneously solve the equations that describe carrier generation, transport, and recombination. However, the proposed model will be stochastic, using random processes to fill and empty states, similar to the true device environment. The stochastic approach should provide a significant improvement in stability and reliability of the simulation results, and is adaptable to more complex physics and geometries than existing modeling approaches. The modeling program will also include an automated data fitting routine to extract device characteristics (e.g. estimation of defect levels) from common, user-supplied performance data (e.g. voltage-photocurrent characteristics).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The completed software package will be made available in an open source environment, be web accessible, and include a public database of model input parameters such as material properties. It will be designed so that casual industry users can access a sophisticated and robust model for simulation or analysis of solar PV device performance from user-supplied data. An educational version of the software package will be developed for use in undergraduate and graduate courses. All of these activities will be carried out by a team of two graduate and two undergraduate students, who will gain expertise in the development of innovative software tools that will support the solar PV research community, industry, and promote student learning.</AbstractNarration>
