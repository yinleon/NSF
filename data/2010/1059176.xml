    <AbstractNarration>This project provides support to Dr. Aly Fathy, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Tennessee Knoxville to organize and host a workshop with Dr. Hadia El-Hennawy, Dean of Engineering, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt on emerging microwave technologies in Cairo Egypt from 20-21 October 2010. The workshop will assess the current status of the science and identify future directions in which to stimulate new research directions for microwave technology including design, material characterization, various engineering aspects and applications. Participation is expected by scientists from the US, Egypt, as well as other countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region including Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan and Lebanon. To further ensure wide participation, this workshop will be held after the IEEE-Microwave Theory and Technology Administrative Committee?s meeting in Cairo, Egypt 16-17 October 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The workshop addresses important technical areas i.e. microwave devices, materials, and related technologies. This is an important area in terms of research that addresses energy harvesting (e.g. solar) as well as many other issues such as wireless communications including ultra-wide band (UWB) communication. The main objective of this workshop is to have in-depth discussions on new technological, experimental, computational, and theoretical advances in processing, characterization, multi-scale modeling in microwave engineering. The workshop will also provide a venue for better understanding the fundamental science underlying new processes and device applications of new semiconductor materials like Gallium Nitride GaN. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed workshop targets areas of global interest namely communications and energy harvesting. The workshop will allow scientists from the U. S. and the MENA region countries to exchange their experiences, ideas, and information about the recent advancement of microwave technologies. The workshop will provide a forum to identify and foster potential collaborations among the workshop participants, which will stimulate new research directions of microwave communications, devices, and energy technology including design, material characterization, various engineering aspects and applications for the benefit of the public and private sectors. This workshop has great potential for developing additional, new collaborations between the participants and the cooperative research derived from this workshop will likely lead to several new and far reaching research and educational activities, as well as economic developments involving the private sectors in the United States and the MENA region countries.</AbstractNarration>
