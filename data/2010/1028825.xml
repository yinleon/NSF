    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research project is to develop a simple single-shot device for measuring the complete intensity and phase vs. time of ultrabroadband supercontinuum?an important light source with simple laser-beam spatial properties but extremely complex white-light spectral properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed device will for the first time measure some of the most complex light pulses ever generated, operating at up to 30,000 pulses per second. It is practical, convenient, accurate, broadband, and reliable and yields feedback on the measurement accuracy. It does not require a reference pulse and can operate over any wavelength range where polarizers and cameras are available. Also, in collaboration with Prof. John Dudley from the University of Franche-Comt√©, this project will use this new device to perform studies of newly discovered ?optical rogue waves? in supercontinuum?intense optical waves considered analogous to large-amplitude water waves observed in the open sea in otherwise calm waters and thought to be responsible for numerous infamous maritime disasters. The proposed device, not only measures such pulses at the high rate required for such studies; it also naturally generates spectrograms, which directly reveal rogue waves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact&lt;br/&gt;All of the many applications of supercontinuum, from biomedical imaging to molecular spectroscopy to remote sensing (lidar) to attosecond-pulse generation to ultra-precise metrology, will benefit greatly from the ability to accurately measure (and hence control) it. Further, this research could lead to improved understanding of oceanic rogue waves and perhaps the discovery of their precursors.</AbstractNarration>
