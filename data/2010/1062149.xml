    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;At the request of the Office of Management and Budget and Office of Science and Technology Policy, the National Research Council will establish the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Science Review panel to identify and summarize the high priority science conducted on Antarctica and the surrounding Southern Ocean that will demand attention over the next two decades. The committee will build upon the work of other organizations to: summarize scientific achievements in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean&amp;#894; identify changes to anticipated types and scope of scientific programs for the U.S. in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean over the next two decades; examine appropriate opportunities for international Antarctic scientific collaborations&amp;#894; report any new emerging technologies that could enhance the U.S. ability to meet science priorities; and recommend broad logistical capabilities that, from a science perspective, should be improved. The Panel will deliver its report within 10-12 months of formation. The outcomes of this study will provide input to a companion blue ribbon panel review assessing logistical needs for the USAP. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This activity will help ensure that USAP research needs are met in the future. The NRC will ensure diversity in committee membership as well as workshop participants. The resulting report will be disseminated widely.</AbstractNarration>
