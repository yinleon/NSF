    <AbstractNarration>The Engineering Pathway Partnership Project (EP3) explores the creation of alternative pathways to mechatronics and engineering-related careers to fill the compelling need in Arizona (and across the nation) for highly-educated technicians in mechanics and electronics. The EP3 model incorporates industry internships that bring technology and engineering into the classroom and the curriculum into the workplace, benefiting both teachers and students. Central to the success of the EP3 model and at the core of the work-based learning experiences is the early introduction of a problem-solving systems approach to engineering and technology through mechatronics in early engineering education. This effort is facilitated in partnership with Science Foundation Arizona STEM Initiative (SFAz STEM), Cochise Community College, Sierra Vista Unified School District, the University of Arizona, the U.S. Army's Fort Huachuca and representative local industry leaders. EP3 is building a rural "pathways" model for identifying, meeting, and then integrating industry standards and workplace competencies into the technical education curriculum at Cochise Community College, enabling further advances in technological education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research design includes questions related to 1) how early engineering experiences and direct exposure to the community college environment can encourage student interest 2) how such a program enables current teachers to be more successful in an increasingly demanding technical curriculum 3) whether those who now teach science and math can be more successful at teaching early engineering and technology and 4) whether authentic engineering experiences within the context of industry impact how students see themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One hundred thirty high school students are to be educated in mechatronics and engineering technology through participation in EP3's student learning initiative which encompasses support from Project Lead the Way (PLTW). Fifteen participating teachers receive professional develop to design curriculum through EP3's Professional Teacher Learning Council which is established to work in concert with industry to address research-driven questions.</AbstractNarration>
