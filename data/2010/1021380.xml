    <AbstractNarration>The productivity of crops has been enhanced and maintained by the application of vast quantities of nitrogen fertilizer (over 100 million tons per year worldwide). Much of this nitrogen, in the form of nitrate, leaches from the soil and contaminates drinking water supplies (both ground and surface) and marine habitats. One approach to alleviating this hazard while preserving crop productivity is to improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in plants; however, a good understanding of nitrogen metabolism and regulation is needed to develop such technologies. Much is known about nitrogen metabolism but little is known about nitrogen regulation especially nitrate sensing and induction. The aim of this proposal is to identify key regulators (both cis and trans-acting) that allow plants to sense and respond to nitrate. A genetic approach will identify new genes that are required for nitrate regulation using a nitrate-responsive reporter gene we constructed. A molecular approach will identify new cis-acting DNA regulatory elements and trans-acting transcription factors using a fast expression assay we have developed. We expect to identify new genes that control nitrate metabolism and uncover new regulatory mechanisms that impact NUE. Such tools and information should lead to the development of new technologies that will improve NUE, which, in turn, will improve crop productivity and reduce the environmental load of agriculture. Students and research personnel will be trained in plant molecular biology and genetics, and efforts will be made to educate K-12 students and the public about plant biotechnology and environmental impacts of agriculture.</AbstractNarration>
