    <AbstractNarration>Litigation versus Administration, and its Implications for Policy and Democracy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Congress enacts a law to regulate some facet of economic or social life where compliance is mandatory, it faces a choice between enforcement through bureaucratic machinery and the use of lawsuits, or some combination of the two in a mixed approach. Since the late 1960s, there has been massive growth in the frequency with which Congress has chosen to implement federal regulatory law by allowing and incentivizing private lawsuits. This project investigates whether, when Congress relies upon the actions of litigants and courts for implementation of regulatory statutes, this choice has consequences for the nature of the legislative process leading to passage, and for the subsequent content of those laws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given Congress' growing reliance upon litigation and courts for regulatory implementation since the late 1960s, shedding light on this question will offer insight into democratic governance and regulatory procedures.</AbstractNarration>
