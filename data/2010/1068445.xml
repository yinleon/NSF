    <AbstractNarration>This project is engaged in improving the long-term retention and graduation rates of the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) majors through the deployment of three educational improvements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. A new STEM-oriented First Year Experience (FYE) to immediately immerse incoming students into methods of scientific inquiry while developing a personal connection to the institution and community. STEM-FYE is designed to fit within the framework of existing general education core courses, immerse students in learning communities that focus on quantitative skills, biological principles, and the process of science, within the overarching topical curricular theme of environmental sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;2. A coherent and expanded structure for recruitment and support designed to increase the diversity of STEM majors. Academic advising of potential STEM majors has been improved and there has been a deliberate integration of mentoring, research, and service-learning opportunities that are available through a variety of campus programs.&lt;br/&gt;3. Building on MESA (Mathematics Engineering Science Achievement) - a 40-year old program supported by the state of California and private industry to improve the achievement of minorities in STEM. This is being accomplished by bringing MESA's best practices to the larger population of STEM majors, including creation of new academic workshop courses for gateway classes in Chemistry and Physics, additional peer and professional mentoring for STEM-student learning communities, and additional undergraduate research opportunities for under-represented students in the physical sciences and technical fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Progress towards the bachelor's degree in STEM is being tracked at the individual student level. External evaluators from WestEd are assessing project success in achieving the learning outcomes defined for the STEM-FYE course and the academic workshops, as well as meeting benchmarks for improving the retention and graduation rate of STEM students.</AbstractNarration>
