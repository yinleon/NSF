    <AbstractNarration>This Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) is intended to study the comparative performance of the alternative humanitarian logistic structures that emerged in response to Port au Prince earthquake. The humanitarian challenge following the January 12, 2010 Haiti earthquake provides important lessons that may end up serving as a watershed moment for the field of humanitarian logistics. Quite notably, while some prominent efforts experienced major delays in the distribution of supplies to the people in need, other unheralded operations did so with great efficiency. Understanding the factors that explain degree of success, and assessing the scalability of the successful ones, could open the doors to new paradigms of humanitarian logistics that overcome the kind of challenges that hampered efforts in Haiti. The project seeks answers to such important questions. In doing so, the team would build upon data collected in the first two weeks after the disaster, validate initial findings with additional data, and create the foundation for the integration of findings into models to support relief flows and operations. The main objectives are to: (1) to identify a preliminary topology, and the basic features of the alternative humanitarian logistic structures that have emerged in Haiti and in areas supporting the effort; (2) to gather insight into their level of effectiveness, positive and negative traits, manpower provided, coverage and extent of their operations, among others; (3) to gather data about the actual flows of critical and non-critical supplies, and their dynamic patterns over time; and (4) to document lessons learned, both positive and negative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project would provide the first systemic characterization of the alternative humanitarian logistic structures that emerge in support of relief/early recovery efforts after a major extreme event. The findings produced by such characterization would: (1) enhance theoretical understandings of organizations and organizing in extreme event environments; and (2) set the stage for advanced modeling of these various approaches. Since improving humanitarian relief operations can reduce human suffering and loss of life in disasters, solving these problems is of national and international import. Specifically, the project will: (1) promote multidisciplinary collaboration on the humanitarian logistics problem; (2) integrate students to a multidisciplinary and international research process, with a particular emphasis on recruiting underrepresented students; (3) generate findings that will be integrated into disaster and logistics courses; (4) generate findings with applied benefits that will be broadly disseminated to organizations engaged in the practice of humanitarian logistics, including those stakeholders in Haiti.</AbstractNarration>
