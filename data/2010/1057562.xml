    <AbstractNarration>Professor Shelley D. Minteer of University of Utah and Professor Joseph Wang of the University of California-San Diego are supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop three-dimensional structures of nano building blocks to be used as supports and current collectors for enzymatic biofuel cells. Hierarchical catalyst supports in which macroscopic and microscopic pore structures are combined and independently controlled will be constructed using either porous carbon materials or templated microchannels. The proposed structures will be used as electrodes in conventional biofuel cells and in biofuel cells within microfluidic channels. The biofuel cell anodes will utilize a pair of NAD-dependent dehydrogenases (lactate and pyruvate dehydrogenase) with lactate as fuel, and with an NADH-recycling electrocatalyst polymer layer on the interior surface of the nanoporous metal layer to facilitate NADH redox chemistry within the nanoporous layer. The work will focus on electrode structure and activity and will seek insights into how these catalyst support structures can correlate with improved bioelectrode performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current enzymatic biofuel cells are hampered by poor enzyme utilization, and the proposed nanostructured electrode design promises to alleviate this deficiency and improve the current/power density for the conversion of chemical energy of a fuel into electrical energy. The project will provide training for graduate and undergraduate and engage students from underrepresented minorities through the involvement of the PIs in a variety of outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>
