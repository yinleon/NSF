    <AbstractNarration>This project will support the Summer School on Fracture to be held in Cargese, France, June 7-19, 2010. The objectives of the Summer School are: (i) to bring together a multidisciplinary group of internationally renowned researchers - physicists, statistical physicists, materials scientists, and engineers - to discuss current research and future trends, and to interact with each other; (ii) to accomplish this in the setting of a Summer School for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows so that young researchers can be brought into the field. The setting of the Summer School is particularly useful because the lectures are to be presented in a classroom format, with detailed descriptions. This format also enables good interactions and potential collaborations between the different groups of researchers. Two sessions of panel discussions are planned in order to summarize the presentations and to evaluate potential areas of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Summer School will provide an educational opportunity for about 30 graduate students and post-doctoral fellows from around the world who will be exposed to advanced topics in fracture, and current and future research trends from world experts. A multi-disciplinary approach is also cultivated by bringing together physicists, materials scientists and engineers. The predominant broader impact is the education and training of the next generation of researchers in the area of fracture. The Summer School also has a global reach, in the sense of bringing together both lecturers and students from different countries.</AbstractNarration>
