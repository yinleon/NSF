    <AbstractNarration>Government agencies at the state and local level are beginning to develop coast management adaption plans for dealing with the effects of climate change. In this Dissertation Improvement Grant Proposal, the co-PI presents hypotheses regarding how planning and priorities at the state and local level differ and interact and how perceptions regarding the importance of uncertainties varies with the scale of governmental units. The hypotheses will be tested using results from a series of 30 semi-structured interviews and a web-based survey to be distributed to 1200 coastal managers in three states. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this research will contribute to understanding how perceived risk and uncertainty influence the analysis and evaluation of adaptation and provide insight into how state-level adaptation plans support local management needs. Results may therefore be used to inform the development of more scale sensitive and policy relevant assessments. Research findings will be published in academic peer-reviewed literature, presented at academic and professional conferences, and packaged into short summaries in formats useful for non-scientists. Such efforts ensure that research, extension, and outreach efforts support local and regional adaptation initiatives</AbstractNarration>
