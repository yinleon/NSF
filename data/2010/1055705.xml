    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Wei Zhang of the University of Colorado Boulder is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research to study a novel class of 3-D cage framework materials (CFMs) that can be readily functionalized and modified. The proposed novel strategy would enable efficiently encoding both dimensional (pore size/distribution) and functional information (guest recognition, sensing, catalysis, etc.) into the final frameworks, thus allowing ready access to a variety of CFMs with precisely controlled pore size and surface functionality in a modular fashion. The aims of the proposed research include (a) synthesizing, characterizing, and evaluating new 3-D organic cage molecules as building blocks for construction of porous functional frameworks, (b) studying highly efficient dynamic covalent chemistry that can provide ready access to 3-D functional organic materials with novel properties and applications, and (c) elucidating the structure-function relationship of the new cage frameworks in molecular separation and chemical sensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Wei Zhang of the University of Colorado Boulder is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research to study a novel class of 3-D cage framework materials (CFMs) that can be readily functionalized and modified. The proposed research will open many new possibilities for developing novel organic-based nanostructured framework materials that can be used for a number of important applications, such as gas separations (e.g., carbon capture), chemical sensing, and heterogeneous catalysis. Such applications are important for many industrial and environmental goals. The proposed work will also be a platform for providing new opportunities for outreach, education, and minority involvement on multiple levels, including development of a new campus-wide Materials &amp; Nanoscience (M&amp;N) training program. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in multidisciplinary research involving organic, inorganic, materials chemistry and nanoscience.</AbstractNarration>
