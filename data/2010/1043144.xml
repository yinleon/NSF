    <AbstractNarration>Spelman College will conduct a 2.5 day regional technical assistance and information conference/workshop for Minority Serving Institutions (MSI) to broaden their participation in programs of NSF's Division of Research on Learning in Formal and Informal Settings (DRL). Spelman College will invite faculty and administrators at accredited MSIs who have not submitted proposals and/or have been unsuccessful in DRL proposal competition to participate in the workshop/conference. The participants will be 50 two-person institutional teams, each consisting of a faculty member from an education specialty relevant to DRL programmatic activities and a faculty member in a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) field supported by NSF. The goal is to have participants develop research or program ideas and to become more skillful in the preparation and development of competitive proposals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference/workshop will take place on the campus of Spelman College, a Historically Black College. A variety of techncial assistance sessions will be used during the workshop to facilitate information sharing and dialogue, including discussion of DRL programs, discussion on proposal development and proposal submission requirements, small group presentations and discussion sessions, and large group hands-on review and evaluation of a proposal feedback session. The major goal of the conference/workshop is not only to increase the numbers of DRL-targeted proposals submitted by faculty from MSIs but the numbers of competitive proposals resulting in awards. The conference/workshop also proposes to enhance awareness of DRL program activities and requirements by providing awareness opportunities for MSI faculty to increase their understanding of DRL programs that foster the integration of research and learning. By exposing MSI faculty to pertinent information and intense mentoring, more independent researchers will have strong proposal development skills.</AbstractNarration>
