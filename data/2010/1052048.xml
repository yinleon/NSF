    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to discover mechanisms through which plants export nitrogen nutrients from leaves to the growing organs. This transport process is essential for optimal plant growth and health, as transport activity affects the accumulation of nutrients in edible parts of the plant, such as seeds and tubers. Grains used as feedstock are often low in protein and essential amino acids, which need to be supplemented at cost to the farmers. Reliance on a single staple food (maize, cassava, rice) is common in the developing world, and often leads to malnutrition because these plant organs are poor in protein and/or essential amino acids. Increasing the capacity of plants to export nitrogen nutrients to edible parts of the plant is expected to lead to more nutritious food containing more protein, and is hence a highly desirable trait. The team led by Okumoto has developed biosensors for glutamine, the amino acid plants mainly use for the export of nitrogen from leaves to edible parts. By using this sensor, the team aims at discovering genes responsible for glutamine export from plant cells. The discovered genes will further be analyzed by Pilot and Okumoto, whose expertise areas are in the transport process of plants. Selected genes will be used for creating plants that are more efficient in nitrogen transport to the storage organs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Plants are familiar to all of us as sources of food, fiber and fuel. Since the process of nitrogen export has an impact on plant growth, and their quality and quantity as food source, this is a great topic to stimulate the interest of high school students and engage them in early scientific research activities. Dolan is the principal investigator of the Partnership for Research and Education in Plants (supported by a Science Education Partnership Award from the National Center for Research Resources). Through this program, high school students conduct authentic scientific research by challenging Arabidopsis mutants with various treatments that have not been tested previously. Okumoto, Pilot and Dolan will collaborate with high school students to investigate the roles of genes discovered through this project. To increase diversity in the academic environment, undergraduate and graduate researchers from underrepresented groups will be recruited through the Multicultural Academic Opportunities Program at Virginia Tech, with whom Okumoto has an established relationship as a participating mentor.</AbstractNarration>
