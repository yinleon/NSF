    <AbstractNarration>Smartphones are fast becoming a full-fledged computing platform that&lt;br/&gt;our society depends upon. Smartphone applications that access data&lt;br/&gt;and computing resources in the "cloud" are inevitable given the&lt;br/&gt;processing and storage limitations on the phones. Today the burden of&lt;br/&gt;partitioning smartphone applications between the phone and the cloud&lt;br/&gt;lies squarely with the programmer. This manual approach to&lt;br/&gt;partitioning applications is fundamentally limited and will not scale&lt;br/&gt;up to allow smartphones to become a truly rich and robust computing&lt;br/&gt;platform. Manual partitioning is tedious and error prone. Moreover,&lt;br/&gt;manual partitioning requires the programmer to make important&lt;br/&gt;decisions that cannot be properly made until run time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the requirements, design, and implementation of&lt;br/&gt;a programming system for cloud-enabled smartphone applications that is&lt;br/&gt;inherently adaptive, partitioning applications transparently in order&lt;br/&gt;to cope with a diverse set of dynamic constraints. The project is&lt;br/&gt;studying cloud-enabled smartphone applications from a variety of&lt;br/&gt;domains in order to understand application requirements, constraints,&lt;br/&gt;and tradeoffs in practice. The project is also pursuing programming&lt;br/&gt;models that allow developers to flexibly and declaratively express an&lt;br/&gt;application's components along with their dependencies and&lt;br/&gt;constraints. Finally, the project is developing a prototype system&lt;br/&gt;architecture that collaboratively executes an application on the phone&lt;br/&gt;and the cloud subject to the application's requirements. Within a&lt;br/&gt;decade, smartphones will transform the way health and lifestyle&lt;br/&gt;choices are delivered to much of the population. This project is&lt;br/&gt;helping to enable this transformation by making a rich class of&lt;br/&gt;smartphone applications much easier to create, adapt, and understand.</AbstractNarration>
