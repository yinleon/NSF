    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the Arctic in Rapid Transition (ART) Initiative is to better&lt;br/&gt;understand multifaceted climate processes across the land-ocean-atmosphere&lt;br/&gt;system. The Initiative began in response to the last International&lt;br/&gt;Conference on Arctic Research Planning (ICARP), which identified the need&lt;br/&gt;for synthesis activities across Arctic system science. Subsequently, the&lt;br/&gt;ART program was established and has two phases. The first phase was&lt;br/&gt;completed in early 2010 with the drafting of a science plan that was the&lt;br/&gt;product of a three day workshop hosted at the International Arctic Research&lt;br/&gt;Center in Fairbanks, Alaska. The workshop brought together more than 50&lt;br/&gt;scientists from nine counties to outline the priorities to be considered&lt;br/&gt;within the ART Initiative. The science plan was presented to the Arctic&lt;br/&gt;Ocean Science Board (AOSB) and endorsed by the International Arctic Science&lt;br/&gt;Committee (IASC) during their annual meeting in Nuuk, Greenland. With the&lt;br/&gt;science plan written, vetted and endorsed by the broader Arctic science&lt;br/&gt;community phase two of the Initiative can now begin. A workshop will be&lt;br/&gt;held at the Freshwater Institute in Winnipeg Canada from October 18 - 20th&lt;br/&gt;to draft an implementation plan based on the research priorities identified&lt;br/&gt;in the science plan. The implementation plan will focus on linkages within&lt;br/&gt;the marine system, including contributions from land-ocean gateways, shelf&lt;br/&gt;seas, and the deep ocean. A range of time scales will also be explored, from&lt;br/&gt;Paleoclimates to the rapid change currently being observed in the Arctic.&lt;br/&gt;As with the science plan, the implementation effort will be organized and&lt;br/&gt;executed almost entirely by early career scientists from five different&lt;br/&gt;nations (U.S., Canada, Norway, Germany, and Sweden) making the ART&lt;br/&gt;Initiative a unique international effort.</AbstractNarration>
