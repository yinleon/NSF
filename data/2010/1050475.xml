    <AbstractNarration>Ubiquitous in soils, streptomycetes are bacteria from which we derive more than half of all clinically useful bioactive compounds. However, we lack a coherent taxonomic framework to explain the ecological and evolutionary significance of antibiotic production in the genus. Horizontal gene exchange is hypothesized to be profound within certain bacterial lineages and is expected to explain taxonomic challenges in Streptomyces. This project will examine genetic diversity in the genus Streptomyces and the evolutionary forces that generate these patterns. The project is transformational in that it examines a new paradigm for understanding the evolutionary history of streptomycetes. This new paradigm should have a dramatic impact on our understanding of microbial evolution and the evolution of antibiotic production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our limited knowledge of the evolutionary history of Streptomyces bacteria has impeded progress in understanding the evolution of antibiotics. Information on the biogeography and evolution of Streptomyces should promote development of rational sampling strategies for discovering diverse strains and novel bioactive compounds. This project includes a novel outreach effort for high school science teachers and students, allowing them to participate in our research efforts through sampling of their local soils. A postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and undergraduates will also receive training and mentorship in this project.</AbstractNarration>
