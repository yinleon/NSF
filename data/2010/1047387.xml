    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop and commercialize an&lt;br/&gt;imaging sensor capable of rapid, non?]intrusive, spatially?]resolved measurement of temperature, and&lt;br/&gt;concentration of chemical species in combustion systems. This imaging sensor system incorporates&lt;br/&gt;diode lasers, a high?]sensitivity measurement technique based on absorption spectroscopy, and data&lt;br/&gt;analysis routines to provide an unprecedented combination of high?]temporal and high?]spatial&lt;br/&gt;resolution, and multi?]dimensional data. In many applications, information about the spatial and&lt;br/&gt;temporal variation of the properties is critical. Examples include the monitoring and control of industrial&lt;br/&gt;combustors and furnaces, where information about the location of the ?ghot spots?h is highly desired; and&lt;br/&gt;the monitoring of indoor air pollutants, where information about the location and diffusion properties&lt;br/&gt;of the contamination sources is critical. The technical goal is a laboratory scale demonstration of the&lt;br/&gt;imaging sensor providing spatial distribution of flow properties.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are that specific markets relevant to this work include both military&lt;br/&gt;and commercial jet engine manufacturers, manufacturers of industrial combustors/burners for power&lt;br/&gt;generation and heat processing, manufacturers of environmental sensors, the academic research&lt;br/&gt;community, and government research laboratories and flight test programs. The initial target&lt;br/&gt;application of the proposed imaging sensor is in the energy and environmental sectors which include the&lt;br/&gt;monitoring and control of combustion systems to reduce pollutant emissions, improve indoor/outdoor&lt;br/&gt;air quality, and maximize fuel efficiency.</AbstractNarration>
