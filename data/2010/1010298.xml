    <AbstractNarration>This project explores from various angles the deep and&lt;br/&gt;intricate connections between the topology and geometry&lt;br/&gt;of a space, the algebraic structure of its fundamental&lt;br/&gt;group, and the algebraic geometry of the associated&lt;br/&gt;cohomology jumping loci. The study is done in a context&lt;br/&gt;which abstracts two of the crucial features that make&lt;br/&gt;the dictionary between topology and algebra work so&lt;br/&gt;well for complements of hyperplane arrangements:&lt;br/&gt;formality (which leads to the Tangent Cone Theorem,&lt;br/&gt;relating the characteristic and resonance varieties), and&lt;br/&gt;quasi-projectivity (which insures that the characteristic&lt;br/&gt;varieties consist of possibly translated subtori). Together,&lt;br/&gt;these two properties put strong constraints on the geometry&lt;br/&gt;of the resonance varieties, leading to powerful obstructions&lt;br/&gt;to finitely presented groups being realizable as fundamental&lt;br/&gt;groups of smooth, (quasi-) projective complex varieties.&lt;br/&gt;Recently, new connections have emerged, relating the cohomology&lt;br/&gt;jumping loci of a space to the homological finiteness properties&lt;br/&gt;of its free abelian covers, and thereby to the structure of the&lt;br/&gt;Dwyer-Fried and Bieri-Neumann-Strebel-Renz invariants.&lt;br/&gt;Generalizations of the classical jump loci---from rank one&lt;br/&gt;local systems to the non-abelian setting, and from cohomology&lt;br/&gt;rings to differential graded algebras---extend the scope of&lt;br/&gt;the investigation, and broaden the range of its applicability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topological and group-theoretic methods utilized&lt;br/&gt;in this project shed new light on the combinatorial and&lt;br/&gt;geometric structure of objects occurring in a variety&lt;br/&gt;of contexts, allowing for cross-pollination between&lt;br/&gt;different fields, with ideas originating in a given area&lt;br/&gt;being fruitfully applied in new settings. The theory of&lt;br/&gt;cohomology jumping loci impacts the study of a wide&lt;br/&gt;array of spaces and groups, including toric complexes&lt;br/&gt;and moment-angle complexes; right-angled Artin and&lt;br/&gt;Coxeter groups; real and complex quasi-toric manifolds;&lt;br/&gt;Kaehler and quasi-Kaehler manifolds; Milnor fibrations&lt;br/&gt;of hyperplane arrangements; as well as configuration&lt;br/&gt;spaces and compactifications of moduli spaces.&lt;br/&gt;The study of these objects, with their multiple&lt;br/&gt;connections to the theory of singularities, graph&lt;br/&gt;theory, and low-dimensional topology, provides a&lt;br/&gt;rich interplay between algebra, topology, and&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, yielding applications to areas&lt;br/&gt;ranging from topological robotics to theoretical&lt;br/&gt;computer science. The investigation is being conducted&lt;br/&gt;together with several collaborators, as well as graduate&lt;br/&gt;and undergraduate students. Participation in intensive&lt;br/&gt;research periods and workshops is meant to introduce a&lt;br/&gt;new generation of students and young researchers to a&lt;br/&gt;very active, interdisciplinary area of study.</AbstractNarration>
