    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) continues support for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Christopher R. Arumainayagam and David R. Haines at Wellesley College for three summers, commencing in 2010. The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program. The research projects span the sub-disciplines of chemistry, as well as interdisciplinary areas of science. Sample projects include: (1) the computational analysis and design of drug molecules for rapidly-mutating targets; (2) the development of novel nanoscale surface modifications; (3) the creation of functionalized nanoparticles as potential treatments for certain forms of cancer; and (4) the study of electron-induced reactions in nanoscale thin films. In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities. In addition to research, students will work mentoring high-school students. The REU site at Wellesley has trained a large number of mostly young women in the sciences. The present site will actively seek to recruit students with disabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training. This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in chemical problems of relevance in a broad range of chemistry sub-disciplines. The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>
