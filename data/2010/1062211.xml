    <AbstractNarration>An award has been made to Iowa State University to continue a Research Experience for Undergraduates Sites (REU) program, which has been running every summer since 1998. This REU program will provide a rich research experience to ten undergraduate students for ten weeks each year, for the summers of 2011- 2013. The program seeks to attract undergraduate students from academic institutions that serve minority populations and from small liberal arts colleges where scientific research opportunities are not readily available. Additionally, this program will actively recruit off-duty National Guard students and veterans. Outstanding students who have finished their freshmen, sophomore or junior years and who have interest in research careers will join a selected group of active investigators at Iowa State campus conducting full-time laboratory research on molecular biology, biotechnology and genomics of animals, microbes and plants. Typical projects will include gene cloning and characterization, functional genomic analyses, expression of foreign genes in bacteria and plants, molecular genetics, and analysis of proteomes and transcriptomes. The student experience will be further enriched by several activities outside the laboratory setting. These structured activities will include bioethics training through lectures, practical exercises, and case studies, as well as weekly seminar and discussion sessions with scientists on different research problems and career options. The program will place emphasis on enhancing students? abilities in critical thinking, problem solving and scientific communication (both written and oral targeted to the general public and scientific communities). The students will also have the opportunity to visit public and private research institutions (such as Pioneer HiBred International and others) and interact with Iowa family farmers to experience rural life. The impact of summer research training will be assessed through formal evaluations during and immediately after the training. In addition, students will have an opportunity to assess the program utilizing a common assessment tool that other REU Program Directors use. Informal contacts by mentors with the students will be used to monitor progress and career decisions of the students. More information is available by visiting http://www.reu.iastate.edu/, or by contacting the Program Directors Dr. Kan Wang (kanwang@iastate.edu; 515-294-4429) or Dr. Max Rothschild (mfrothsc@iastate.edu), or by email reu@iastate.edu.</AbstractNarration>
