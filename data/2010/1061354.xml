    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide $250,000 to the Florida State University for the acquisition of a sector magnet inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (SM-ICP-MS). This instrument will replace a 14-year-old ELEMENT1 in a common facility used by several earth science researchers. The manufacturer does not support service on that instrument anymore and spare parts are scarce. The instrument over the last few years has seen significant downtime due to more and more frequent breakdown of components. FSU will match the NSF contribution at the amount of $250,000 for a total budget of $500,000. FSU also supports this ICP-MS facility with a state-funded technical position. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new instrument will support a variety of funded projects. Several ongoing research programs at FSU are critically dependent upon the availability of in-house state-of-the-art ICP-MS capability, especially: (1) studies of iron cycling in the ocean in relation to global carbon cycling; (2) studies of aerosolized trace metal deposition in the sea; (3) studies of the global mercury cycle; and geochemical dynamics of the Earth's mantle and crust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: The Geochemistry Program of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory supports graduate students (12 present) and post-docs (3) that will use this instrument in their research. The instrument is essential for projects that are part of larger scale research programs such as CLIVAR and GEOTRACES. Apart from the research of the primary PIs and their students and post-docs, the instrument will contribute to the research of other faculty in the Department of Earth Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, as well as faculty of the Department of Chemistry, the NHMFL and users outside FSU.</AbstractNarration>
