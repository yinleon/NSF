    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to measure, at the single-molecule level, the electrical and mechanical interactions between individual carbon nanotubes and DNA molecules. The approach is to use state-of-the-art dual-trap optical tweezers to bring a single DNA molecule close to a suspended carbon nanotube, which is part of an ultra-sensitive carbon nanotube transistor in a liquid environment. Through precise photoconductance and force measurements, the electrical and mechanical coupling between individual DNA molecules and carbon nanotubes will be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The research is the first direct measurement of molecular interactions in DNA-carbon-nanotube hybrids, which will provide currently unavailable data to understand the structural and functional properties of DNA-carbon-nanotube hybrids. This fundamental understanding will clarify the interaction mechanisms between DNA molecules and carbon nanotubes, which will lead to the power of predictive design of nanobiohybrids. Therefore, the obtained fundamental knowledge will move the frontier of DNA-carbon nanotube nanobiohybrids. Moreover, the proposed research will provide an approach to explore the complex interfaces in other nanobiohybrids.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The acquired fundamental knowledge and predictive power will produce transformative impacts to many technological fields, including tissue engineering, drug delivery, biosensors, and diagnostic imaging. In addition, the PI proposes an integrated research and education plan, including (1) a new laboratory course introducing cutting-edge techniques in nanotechnology, (2) a NanoChina program providing an international research experience to undergraduate students, (3) a nano-biotechnology module highlighting optical, material and biomedical applications with hands-on laboratories to K-12 students, and (4) special women's sessions at the Vanderbilt Nanoday workshop.</AbstractNarration>
