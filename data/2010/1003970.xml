    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: EPS-1003970&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Advancing and Supporting Science, Engineering, and Technology II&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Arkansas Science and Technology Authority&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RII-4 proposal seeks to enhance Arkansas?s scientific research capability by focusing on three areas in renewable energy: plant biosynthesis, alternate energy, and nanotechnology. The research in the plant biosynthesis area will focus on efficient plant-based bioproduction of high-value proteins, unique bioactive chemicals, and renewable biomaterials. The development of cost-effective, high efficiency solar cells is the objective the alternate energy area. The research in the nanotechnology area is directed at the fabrication of new materials to be integrated into photovoltaic devices. The Arkansas researchers proposed to package these devices, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be conducted in three existing Arkansas centers: the Center for Plant-Powered Production (P3 Center), the Center for Generating Renewable Energy with Efficient Nanoplasmonic Solar Cells (GREEN Center), and the Vertically Integrated Center for Transformative Energy Research (VICTER).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the compelling nature of the research, both in terms of the potential for advancing science and as a national need. Solar cells and photovoltaic materials offer an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. Green plants, capture and convert solar energy to sugars, oils and a vast array of chemicals contributing to both energy and chemical feed-stocks enabling. Significant challenges remain for cost-effective renewable energy sources that are capable of seamless integration into the national power grid. The P3 Center will explore the fundamental mechanisms involved in the synthesis, regulation, trafficking and storage of phytochemicals and the basis of bioactivity of these phytochemicals on target organisms The GREEN Center is focused on the development of cost-effective, high-efficiency solar cells that utilize surface plasmon photonics and unique nanomaterials. The discovery, fabrication and utilization of new nanoscale materials and films for alternate energy needs will be addressed in the VICTER Center.The proposed research will enable multidisciplinary teams to focus on key issues in solar cell efficiency and plasmonics, in PV materials, packaging, and integration into the power grid, and in enhancing the ability of plants to function as factories for biofuels, bioactive phytochemicals and biomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project has significant depth in its outreach activities. The project expands on the previous RII proposal by including two Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) institutions and two 4-year colleges. Numerous secondary school research activities and professional development for teachers and two-year college faculty are proposed in order to support the STEM pipeline. There are tightly woven educational and workforce development activities directly tied to the specific research themes. Heavy emphasis is placed on summer research experiences for undergraduates. The project provides internships for Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) students to expand matriculation into graduate programs. There is a program of mentoring for graduate students, postdoctoral and young faculty. Numerous activities support public engagement such as Research Day at the Capital, REU research competition at annual meetings, and competitions such as the solar boat race. External Engagement and Workforce Development are addressed in part by ensuring that the three centers have incorporated interactions with industry and/or expectation of technology spin-off companies.</AbstractNarration>
