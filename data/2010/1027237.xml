    <AbstractNarration>This NSF award by the Chemical and Biological Separations program makes funds available to assist with a symposium entitled New Materials and Concepts for Next Generation Membrane. The symposium will be held at the 2010 International Chemical Congress of Pacific Basin Societies (i.e., Pacifichem 2010) in Honolulu, HI from Dec. 15-20, 2010. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New materials for membranes play an important role in this area because efficient separations of fluids are important for biofuels purification, water remediation, fuel cell operation, etc. The organizers of the New Materials and Concepts for Next Generation Membranes symposium are the PI from the University of Colorado at Boulder, USA; Prof. Kazu Nagai from Meiji University, Japan; and Prof. Normand Voyer from Laval University, Canada. This symposium will focus on new materials design approaches and chemical concepts that potentially could be used to develop unprecedented membranes with new or enhanced separation capabilities. The overall goal of this symposium is to bring together rsearchers who make new functional porous and dense materials but have little membranes experience, with membrane experts at the cutting edge of new membranes development and application. The goal is to have this international forum for sharing new materials ideas and membrane needs/possibilities will catalyze new collaborations and enable development of next generation membranes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested NSF funds will be used to cover registration fees for invited speakers, young professors and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The abstracts from the symposium will be made accessible via the Internet to the general public as a research and educational tool. The symposium will also serve as an important international platform for allowing young U.S. scientists (i.e., starting professors, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows) to participate in and learn about the exciting opportunities at the intersection of materials chemistry (of all forms) and membrane science and engineering. It is hoped that this Pacifichem 2010 symposium will encourage more young (i.e., the next-generation of) materials chemists in the U.S. and other countries to apply their skills in that direction. The PI plans to have extensive young scientist participation in the talk sessions by choosing young chemists and membrane engineers to give a large portion of the contributed talks. In doing so, new and often revolutionary ideas and concepts in membrane materials and design will be highlighted.</AbstractNarration>
