    <AbstractNarration>The objective this research project is to understand the link among the electronic- atomic- and micro-scale properties of Calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) and hardened cement. CSH is the dominant building block component of the hardened portland cement and the key microstructure that controls the overall mechanical behavior of portland cement concrete. To significantly enhance concrete performance and durability, technologies to modify CSH structure and properties are being envisaged. This research will use a combination of rigorous theoretical and innovative experimental methods to investigate the fundamental science issues governing CSH structure and properties. These investigations will identify the gap between what is theoretically possible and what is experimentally achievable, and consequently, suggest plausible strategies for future cementitious material development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concrete is the most utilized construction material across the world. Life cycle performance enhancement of concrete can have far reaching impact on sustainability and energy use of the concrete and cement industries. In addition, this interdisciplinary multi-institutional research will contribute to the development of highly skilled graduate workforce. The Ph.D. students will be mentored by PIs with diverse background and experience in collaborative research on complex problems that occur at the boundaries of traditional disciplines. The research results and techniques will be highlighted at the campus outreach events designed to attract high school students into STEM disciplines and recruit undergraduate students into graduate programs. The methods developed in this research will have applications in the analysis of a wide class of materials possessing complex multi-component microstructures, such as shales and nanophased ceramics.</AbstractNarration>
