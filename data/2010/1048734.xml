    <AbstractNarration>1048734&lt;br/&gt;O'Connell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Twelfth International Conference on Properties and Phase Equilibria for Product and Process Design is scheduled for May 16 - 21 2010, in Suzhou, Jiangsu, China, with a similar format to the successful previous Conferences, but with innovative contemporary session topics and workshops on new and unique subjects. Based on abstracts submitted for presentation, the 12th Conference is planned for 300 technical participants, apparently because the location, costs and timing are quite attractive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award provides funds for travel for as many needy US academic researchers as possible?of the order of ten--given the modest travel support provided. It is likely that high air fares to Asia on US carriers will limit the funds for each individual to less than needed. Those supported would include only presenters of invited lectures and young research workers who would not be able to attend without such support. No request is made for local expenses, meeting organization costs, or for non-US participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This Conference will gather the most important international researchers on the vital area of properties and phase equilibria for product and process design to review progress and to uncover the next generation of problems and their potential solutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Global state-of-the-art in this important area will be articulated and advanced. American participation is essential for making contributions to the general knowledge base, for building awareness of global activities, and for fostering international collaborations. Knowledge in some of these areas would have impact on energy production / manufacturing of fuels, and process safety and reliability. One timely topic may deal with conditions for the formation, storage, and control of methane hydrates.</AbstractNarration>
