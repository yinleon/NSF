    <AbstractNarration>Chen&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1008905&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The objective of this project is to provide a systematic&lt;br/&gt;study of multi-phase transitions. There are macroscopic free&lt;br/&gt;boundary models, which are based on observable quantities and are&lt;br/&gt;needed to deal with singularities due to topological changes of&lt;br/&gt;free boundaries, and microscopic continuum models, derived at the&lt;br/&gt;molecular level and (always) well-posed. One goal of the project&lt;br/&gt;is to derive critical information from continuum models for free&lt;br/&gt;boundary models when the latter become indeterminate. Another is&lt;br/&gt;to develop new microscopic continuum models for phase transitions&lt;br/&gt;among phases such as solid/liquid and different grains in a&lt;br/&gt;polycrystalline material. The main tools used here are theories&lt;br/&gt;of partial differential equations, singular perturbations,&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic expansions, complex analysis, bifurcation, center&lt;br/&gt;manifolds, global analysis, dynamical systems, and geometric&lt;br/&gt;measure. From time to time, computer assistance is used to first&lt;br/&gt;stimulate, then validate, and further extend theoretical&lt;br/&gt;conclusions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator studies interfacial phenomena, which are&lt;br/&gt;commonplace in nature and occur whenever there is a continuum&lt;br/&gt;that can exist in at least two different phases and there is some&lt;br/&gt;mechanism that generates a spatial separation of these phases. &lt;br/&gt;The spatial boundaries that separate these phases, referred to as&lt;br/&gt;interfaces or free boundaries, evolve with time due to some&lt;br/&gt;enforcement of transitions of phases from one to another. A&lt;br/&gt;typical two-phase transition is a solidification process of a&lt;br/&gt;liquid. A classical multi-phase transition arises from&lt;br/&gt;evolutions of grains in a polycrystal where alignments of atoms&lt;br/&gt;in different grains do not match at grain boundaries. The growth&lt;br/&gt;of a solid polycrystal from a liquid involves a two-phase&lt;br/&gt;transition between liquid and solid and a multi-phase transition&lt;br/&gt;among grains. These phenomena motivate new theoretical&lt;br/&gt;development in free boundary problems, systems of parabolic or&lt;br/&gt;elliptic partial or ordinary differential equations, and&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems. Insights gained from the project increase&lt;br/&gt;connections between mathematicians and materials scientists. New&lt;br/&gt;models developed here provide scientists with tools for&lt;br/&gt;understanding and designing new materials.</AbstractNarration>
