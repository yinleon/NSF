    <AbstractNarration>The Richard Stockton College of New Jersey provides twenty-five S-STEM scholarships each year for talented yet financially disadvantaged students pursuing baccalaureate degrees in computer science and information systems, engineering, computational science or mathematics. The program increases both undergraduate retention and placements in graduate schools or STEM careers. Special outreach activities include awareness campaigns, faculty involvement with high schools/county colleges and a computer fair. Special mentoring is provided to attract and retain female CSIS majors. Academic support is provided by especially designed courses such as 'Bridges Connecting Computer Science and Calculus' which has resulted in a 20% improvement in performance in calculus. The 'Women in Computing' course targets first year students to increase and retain female majors. Among the women who intend to major in CSIS, 100% of those in this course are still CSIS majors at the end of the second year and beyond. Tutoring in programming, mentoring and internship and research experiences are also offered. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program builds on a previous successful NSF project which resulted in a 96% retention rate and a 10% increase in GPAs among participating students. Every graduate found a major-related job or acceptance into graduate school. Seventy-three percent of Stockton students qualify for financial need and 26% are first-generation college students. This scholarship program enables students to work less and focus on academics.</AbstractNarration>
