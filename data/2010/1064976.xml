    <AbstractNarration>Multi-core computing, where several processor cores are combined together into a single chip, has become&lt;br/&gt;the standard in computer processor design. In effect, each chip has become a small parallel computer&lt;br/&gt;and leveraging the processing power of parallel computing efficiently is a difficult challenge. Parallel&lt;br/&gt;computing attempts to accelerate computational tasks by separating the work into segments that can be&lt;br/&gt;calculated independently using different processors. Unfortunately, these processors need to communicate&lt;br/&gt;with each other to complete the computational tasks correctly. This communication and the resulting&lt;br/&gt;access to data are major limiting factors to how much a computational task can be accelerated with&lt;br/&gt;multiple processors.&lt;br/&gt;This research proposes a cooperatively designed system that considers the method for storing and accessing&lt;br/&gt;data (memory), the method for communication between processors (network), the software that&lt;br/&gt;controls how programs are executed (operating system), and the design of the program executables themselves&lt;br/&gt;(compilation) to maximize the program execution speed. The key observation is that while each&lt;br/&gt;component of the system can be improved independently, each component contains information that can&lt;br/&gt;help the other components to realize even greater benefits. Just as a transportation infrastructure requires&lt;br/&gt;information about traffic patterns; for example, if traffic patterns were ignored and if highways connect&lt;br/&gt;rural areas and only side streets connect major cities, traffic would reach a standstill while highways are&lt;br/&gt;inefficiently used. Likewise, the communication network cannot be efficiently designed without information&lt;br/&gt;from programs on communication patterns.&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes from this project will be the development of ?cross-layer? design concepts for multi-core&lt;br/&gt;computer architectures that will result in performance improvements and effective use of more processor&lt;br/&gt;cores within a single chip.</AbstractNarration>
