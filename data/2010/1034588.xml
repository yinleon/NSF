    <AbstractNarration>Martinsville and HenryCounty National Society of Black Engineers aims to break the cycle of poverty for African American youth in Martinsville by introducing them to the field of engineering through its program: Achiever's Plus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is providing an opportunity to 50 African American students (grade 7 to 12) at Martinsville and Henry County chapter of NSBE to participate in Regional and National conventions. The regional convention will take place in Pennsylvania in the first week of November 2010, while the NSBE National Convention is to be held in Saint Louis, Missouri in March of 2011. The students in this chapter have attended the last year regional conference in North Carolina and competed in Math, Robotics, Science and Leadership competitions. The chapter won 16 awards including the chapter with the highest grade point average. In addition, the students took first, second and third place in science division; and will compete again this year in Saint Louis MO. This activity will enhance the following:&lt;br/&gt;Bolster the students' self-esteem and give them a sense of accomplishment; encourage and assist them in improving school attendance, and school performance; and, importantly, expose African American youth in the area to college-level and career opportunities in math, science, and technology-related fields, with a special emphasis on engineering fields. This proposal is exempt from external review in accordance with the PAM, Chapter V.B.2.n.</AbstractNarration>
