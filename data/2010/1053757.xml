    <AbstractNarration>High-bandwidth, semi-private optical lambda networks carry growing volumes of data on behalf of large datacenters, both in cloud computing environments and for scientific, financial, defense, and other enterprises. These networks are treated as if they are perfect. However, it is not uncommon for them to suffer from unexpected performance degradations and loss rates, even when traffic is well-below capacity. This project studies end-to-end characteristics of lambda networks running at high speeds over long distances, with an eye toward better understanding loss, latency variations, and degraded throughput. This understanding is necessary for the design and efficient use of next-generation lambda networks and to enable the transition to cloud computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research described in this project will focus on measuring, characterizing, modeling, and informing new network and protocol design for optical lambda networks. The educational activities will make aspects of network research more accessible to students; promote research initiative among undergraduate and graduate students, and leverage (interdisciplinary) collaborations between Cornell and Howard University, a historically black college and university (HBCU).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Fundamental science requires well controlled experiments and observation. The research described in this project will produce novel network measurement instruments, along with a body of experimental knowledge needed for building networks and protocols that exhibit high performance. The research agenda has three major components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Further Development of the Software Defined Network Adapter (SDNA) that the PI has designed. SDNA provides precise and reproducible measurements of an optical lambda network. By achieving extremely high levels of precision, SDNA can shed light on the complexities of flows that traverse high-speed networks.&lt;br/&gt;- Use of SDNA to measure and characterize optical lambda networks. These measurements will help explain observed packet loss at low data rates and reveal new aspects of network behavior.&lt;br/&gt;- Research and deploy new network protocols that enhance end-to-end performance perceived by applications.&lt;br/&gt;New network protocols will allow application developers and datacenter operators to better take advantage of the capacity of the underlying optical networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The education/outreach agenda is designed to foster an environment for developing a new generation of network researchers who will take a keen interest in hands-on experimentation. There are two major components:&lt;br/&gt;- Research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students as well as faculty during the summer and in a semester-long class. This will include exploring the design of hardware and software layers for an SDNA apparatus and using SDNA to conduct network research and analyze network measurements.&lt;br/&gt;- A partnership with Howard University (an HBCU) to collaborate on network research and inspire the next generation of underrepresented minority researchers.</AbstractNarration>
