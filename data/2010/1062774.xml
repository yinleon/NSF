    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and Research Experience for Teachers (RET) site at the University of Oklahoma Norman Campus. The award will support ten undergraduates and two teachers per year in research projects including opportunities in astrophysics, condensed matter, atomic and molecular physics or high energy physics. The primary goal of the site is to bridge the gap from student to scientist. This is done through substantive, consequential research mentored daily by a faculty member in an area in which the student or teacher is interested. In addition, there will be a semiweekly seminar series covering the language of quantum mechanics, career options in each of four disciplines of physics, and career development. The final seminars will be given by the students themselves presenting their own work. In addition, the site offers a series of voluntary courses, field trips and seminars that expose the students to real research tools. Teachers will participate in the seminar series, research, and develop classroom-ready research-grade experiments.</AbstractNarration>
