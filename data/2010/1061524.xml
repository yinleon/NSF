    <AbstractNarration>The intellectual focus of this three-year REU site is Advanced Functional Membranes. REU students will apply specialized synthesis, characterization, and modeling techniques to develop (1) membranes for highly efficient protein separations that translate into increased productivity and lower cost therapeutics; (2) nanocomposite membranes for the recovery of CO2 from natural gas and emissions generated by fossil fuels combustion to lessen the impact of global warming; (3) membranes for electrochemical energy storage and conversion; (4) foul-resistant, self-cleaning membranes for the recovery of our most precious resource, potable water; and (5) responsive membranes with switchable surface properties and controllable barrier properties for applications such as controlled drug release. This program will engage undergraduate students in research aimed at providing membrane based solutions to grand societal challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Ten undergraduates will participate each summer. Students will be identified through a national search. Recruiting also will be done at targeted institutions that include eight HBCUs and a residential college for women. As part of the educational program, students learn the basics of membrane science and the technical background needed for their research projects; safe laboratory practice; methods on planning, executing and communicating scientific research; ethical conduct of research; challenges associated with moving scientific research from the laboratory to the market; and strategies for preparing competitive fellowship and graduate school applications. In addition, the students will attend the North American Membrane Society Annual Meeting to learn about the latest research in membrane science and engineering. Participants will present their work and engage in discussions with the global membrane research community using a new, interactive "virtual poster session" platform that will be unique to this REU program. Graduates of this REU Site program will be well prepared for graduate research and productive research careers generating tremendous opportunities for society, from improving the quality and cost of healthcare, to producing a cleaner and safer environment.</AbstractNarration>
