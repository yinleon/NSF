    <AbstractNarration>This three-year REU Site program at Johns Hopkins University and Hospital (JHU/H) is multidisciplinary and offers undergraduate participants the ability to conduct research in a variety of fields and develop strong teamwork collaboration skills. During a ten-week summer session REU students will engage in exciting and challenging research projects in a wide range of engineering disciplines; e.g. electrical, mechanical and biomedical, computer science, and physics. Each participant will be matched with a current research project in the new Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR) and will be a part of a research team, including a faculty mentor and a graduate student mentor. These research projects relate to medical image registration and fusion, image enhancement and segmentation or the development of new robotic devices to support surgeons in the operating room or to aid patients with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to enhance the directed research, many additional enrichment activities are included: 1) instruction on technical communication; 2) oral presentation skills; and 3) research ethics. Additional activities include tours and trips to other labs at JHU Hospital and the Applied Physics Laboratory, the opportunity to perform laparoscopic procedures at the JHU/H Minimally Invasive Surgical Training Center, and industry tours of local robotics, biotechnology and engineering companies. Students will also participate in social activities to foster team a sense of community within the undergraduate student group. The program will culminate with a program devoted to final presentations from REU participants with their PIs, graduate student mentors, lab mates, and parents all present. An award for the best presentation will be presented by LCSR leadership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment efforts will be targeted to potential participants from institutions nationwide, with a focus on women and under-represented minorities, and from a wide range of engineering disciplines including electrical, mechanical, biomedical, computer science, mathematics, and physics. By recruiting from and partnering with LSAMP, McNair, SWE, SHPE, and other similar programs, this program will aid in the development of a pipeline of qualified, diverse practitioners who will contribute to the workforce in the area of STEM, particularly in the multi- and inter-disciplinary subjects encountered in the computational sensing, medical robotics, prosthetics, and computer integrated medical intervention areas.</AbstractNarration>
