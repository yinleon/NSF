    <AbstractNarration>Polar oceans will undergo substantial physical and chemical changes under currently predicted climate scenarios. The effects on the unique biota of Antarctica are expected to be rapid relative to their slow life histories, and gaps remain in understanding of their physiology. The Antarctic sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri will be used to investigate the physiological effects of ocean acidification during larval development. The PI will use lipid biochemistry measurements taken from sea urchin larvae cultured under high pCO2 to test 3 hypotheses: 1) Development will come at a higher energetic cost under lower pH conditions, despite low metabolic rates; 2) A loss of pH homeostasis will lead to impaired enzyme function, which would account for decreased metabolic rates, and also decreased fertilization success; 3) Complex multifactorial effects of acidification will be the basis for sub-lethal impacts on physiology; these effects will be revealed in coordinates changes in protein. Specially designed culture equipment, which allows for manipulation of carbonate chemistry, will be used to culture larvae under conditions of high pCO2, simulating future atmospheric conditions. Lipid biochemistry will be measured during development to determine energetic budgets, and enzyme activities of key metabolic and homeostatic enzymes will be assessed. Proteomic analysis will be used to observe translational changes relative to transcriptome analysis. The broader impacts of the study include increased representation of Asian-American women in marine and polar science, and dissemination of ocean acidification science to a general audience through an established ocean change information clearing-house.</AbstractNarration>
