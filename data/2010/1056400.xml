    <AbstractNarration>In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program, Professor Jacob W. Ciszek of Loyola University Chicago and his students will engage in three areas of exploration, all&lt;br/&gt;unified through the use of photochromic (switching) molecules, whose unique properties allow stimuli controlled and reversible changes to be induced in the underlying substrate. The areas of focus will be: 1) The effect of photochromic switching molecules on the work function and core binding energy of the substrate metal surface; 2) Determination of the distance dependence of metal surface-induced quenching of molecular&lt;br/&gt;adsorbate excited states, and 3) Exploration of the effect of self-assembled monolayers on the carrier density and conductivity within a semiconducting organic crystal substrate. The principal tools will be&lt;br/&gt;organic synthesis, infrared reflection spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Kelvin probe (for work function determination). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aforementioned research topics have implications for the technology used in everyday life. For example, project one is relevant to organic light emitting diodes and solar cells. Projects 2 and 3 are relevant to&lt;br/&gt;the emerging field of molecular electronics. Project 2 also has implications for luminescence-based biosensing technologies. The research activity in the Ciszek laboratory will also have educational&lt;br/&gt;implications, through the training of graduate and undergraduate students, the on-going development of a semester-long course in nanoscience, and the participation of Ciszek research group members in&lt;br/&gt;annual workshops on scientific research targeted at high school audiences. Professor Ciszek and his students will also participate in a series of science seminars for the general public. Future innovations in&lt;br/&gt;this area include the adaptation of selected topics in the nanoscience course for the general public seminars.</AbstractNarration>
