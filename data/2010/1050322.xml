    <AbstractNarration>Many organisms pass through two or more distinct stages during the course of their lifetime (a complex life cycle). Although the number and duration of life stages varies extensively in nature, little is known about how this might affect reproductive compatibility between individuals exhibiting different life cycle types. This study incorporates population genetic, behavioral and morphological analyses to test this phenomenon in a species of salamander that exhibits extensive life cycle variation within and among populations. The experiments are designed to test whether this variation in life cycle results in rapid reproductive isolation and shifts in the rate of morphological evolution and diversification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates the consequences of altering a complex life cycle on patterns of biodiversity, speciation, and macroevolution. The project supports the training of undergraduate and graduate students in conducting integrative research. The research will be further disseminated to local high school teachers through workshops. These workshops will demonstrate modern ecological, anatomical, and genetic research tools and techniques, and assist teachers in developing exercises to infuse this knowledge into their curricula. This research will also produce a large-scale genetic resource that can be used by the community of researchers that study amphibians.</AbstractNarration>
