    <AbstractNarration>1067979 University of Kentucky; Kozo Saito &lt;br/&gt;1067995 Clemson University; Mohammed Omar &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Painting/Coating Applications and Surface Inspection Systems will focus on painting/coating materials, formulations, finishes and interfacial behavior, paint and coating applications, curing and inspections systems for the automotive sector as well as others. The University of Kentucky (UKY) and Clemson University (CU) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with UKY as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work plans to overcome the technology transfer challenges in coatings and paint segments of the automotive industry. This goal will be achieved by (i) involving industry in precompetitive research, and (ii) conducting focused research in areas such as paint application, monitoring of surface finish, and quality control. A number of fundamental projects are proposed including pollution control by capturing and recycling paint sludge, corrosion protection, paint defect inspection tools, "green" methods of curing paint, reduction in energy during painting process, and developing new equipment to minimize/eliminate paint overspray. PIs are highly qualified and have a proven track record of conducting industry focused research, and successfully transferring research innovations to industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal includes a discussion of the typical technology transfer of research results to industry via reports to the IAB members, and the use of graduate students in the research effort. Beyond the targeted automotive industry, the potential impact of the center's technology affects almost every major US capital good industry. The PI has a directed plan and positive track record for inclusion of under-represented ethnic groups. Proposed research activities will involve researchers from different academic disciplines at the two campuses. Student researchers will be encouraged to participate in the planning and implementation phases of various research projects.</AbstractNarration>
