    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a joint research workshop on Bio-inspired Sensing and Actuation Technologies (BISAT) to be held in Shanghai, China, November 8-12, 2010. Its objectives include promotion of research collaboration between researchers in the two countries and particularly engagement of researchers from both the life sciences and engineering to stimulate cross-disciplinary as well as transnational collaborations. The program, which will involve about 40 participants including some advanced students and young researchers, will focus on the formulation of a vision for new approaches to BISAT and its opportunities. The meeting is intended to promote linkages between the research communities in the two countries. The Chinese participation will be supported by the National Science Foundation of China.&lt;br/&gt; The workshop will engage leading researchers from two domains of science from the two countries to produce a vision and a roadmap for future interdisciplinary research efforts in BISAT. Both countries have identified this area as a high priority for development because of the wide range of possible applications. It is expected that the resulting cross-fertilization will be quite productive.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to addressing numerous research issues in the field, the workshop will discuss practical applications of new bio-inspired sensing and actuation technologies to critical areas of societal concern such as infrastructure health and medical systems. Also, participation of students in the workshop will have an educational impact. The meeting will bring together participants from both countries to establish long-term collaborative relationships.</AbstractNarration>
