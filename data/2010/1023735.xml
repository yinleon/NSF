    <AbstractNarration>This research team will investigate the fundamental causes of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) using simulations of solar active region formation by flux emergence from the convection zone into the corona. To accomplish their goals, the team members will utilize a new magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code being developed by the Center for Radiation Shock Hydrodynamics (CRASH) at the University of Michigan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CRASH code adds radiation transport and advance treatment of the equation-of-state to the MHD capabilities of existing models developed at Michigan, and will allow the simulation of flux emergence from a turbulent convection zone to the corona in a single computational domain. The Principal Investigator of this project will incorporate this numerical flux emergence component in Michigan's Space Weather Modeling Framework, in order to couple the solar-active-region-scale model to a global-scale coronal model extending to the Earth. The model's predictions will be compared to observations made at different levels in the solar atmosphere, including plasma flow fields in the convection zone determined with helioseismology, flow fields in the corona determined with Dopplergrams, and magnetic fields measured at the photosphere with vector magnetographs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new coupled modeling system will address a key National Space Weather Program objective by simulating magnetic flux emerging from the convection zone into the solar corona, erupting and then propagating as a CME into interplanetary space. It thus spans the space weather forecasting domain from Sun to Earth. This research will also support undergraduate and graduate education. Specifically, the requested funding will primarily support a graduate student, while research results will be incorporated into courses in the Department of Atmospheric, Ocean, and Space Science at the University of Michigan.</AbstractNarration>
