    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this grant is to decipher the underpinning science of graphene's morphologic instabilities under various external stimuli, and explore novel concepts to push the limits of graphene-based nanostructures of high sensitivity for graphene-based sensing. Graphene consists of carbon atoms densely patterned in a honeycomb lattice. Graphene's two dimensional structure exposes its entire volume to its surrounding with well amenable surface chemistry, making it a highly efficient and promising candidate material for sensing. However, graphene-based sensing up to single molecule level often accompanies ultra small amplitude of indicators of change, posing significant challenge to the success of graphene-based sensing. Recent research revealed graphene's morphologic instability, which can lead to a sharp change in graphene properties, thus substantially increase the amplitude of indicator of external stimuli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By deciphering the fundamental science of graphene-based ultrasensitive nanostructures under various external stimuli and interferences, this research will offer new inroads towards a wide range of exciting sensing applications. The strongest material ever demonstrated, graphene enables mechanically robust nanostructures, allowing unattended sensing/actuation under repeated external stimuli over long term. The widespread use of graphene-based sensing will make significant impacts on health monitoring of civil, mechanical and manufacturing. On the educational front, this project will leverage cyberinfrastructures to significantly broaden the impact of the research and educational activities.</AbstractNarration>
