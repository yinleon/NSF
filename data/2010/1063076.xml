    <AbstractNarration>Fordham University and the Louis Calder Center - Biological Field Station have been awarded funding to support 10 students each summer in a 12-week research program in ecology and conservation biology, with a strong emphasis on effects of urbanization. Students will collaborate with mentors to design research projects that test critical questions, and lead to success in graduate school and employment in growing areas of ecology and environmental sciences. The goal is to help students become leaders of their research projects and in the years to come, leaders in science and environmental stewardship. Students who have limited opportunities to conduct ecological research will be provided training and research opportunities within a field station setting, and free on-site housing, travel support and ready access to research mentors with expertise ranging from population genetics to ecosystem processes. Students can address critical conservation issues within an urban-suburban landscape, and examine the link between scientific research and benefits to society. The proximity of the field station to New York City also offers students a sharp focus on human impacts to biological systems. Links with scientists at the Wildlife Conservation Society, Bronx Zoo and New York Botanical Garden will offer a broad array of research opportunities. Students will be guided to formulate and defend their hypotheses, and design and complete their research within the 12-week period. Students will disseminate their findings in oral and poster presentations at scientific conferences, in undergraduate theses, and in peer-reviewed publications. The CSUR-REU program targets highly motivated students interested in pursuing a career in ecology and conservation biology. Program success will be assessed using the NSF BIO-REU common assessment tool, and an anonymous Students' Evaluation of Educational Quality (SEEQ) form developed at Fordham. Students from institutions with limited opportunities for research, urban backgrounds, or from groups under-represented in science are especially encouraged to apply. Students interested in applying can obtain more information by visiting the website www.fordham.edu/REUatCalder, or contacting REUatCalder@fordham.edu or 914-273-3078 ext. 27.</AbstractNarration>
