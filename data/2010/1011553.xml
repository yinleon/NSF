    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Science Master's Program in Translational Biotechnology &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Master's-level trained scientists are needed within academic institutions and America's growing biotechnology industry. There are many attractive and well paying job opportunities that are integral in supporting product discovery, product development, manufacturing, testing, and commercialization. These activities are foundational for companies, and are increasingly gaining importance in the academic setting where new technologies are being tested in humans prior to entering the commercial sector. The Science Master's Program in Translational Biotechnology will enable students to acquire expertise in both scientific/engineering and business/managerial knowledge and skills that meet the needs of employers and prepare graduates for employment. The program brings together disciplines in biosciences and business, and is research intensive with deep industry involvement, including a formal internship. Through this innovative program, the graduate-level curriculum will provide graduates with additional career options, and will create a pathway for displaced and unemployed/underemployed workers for re-training and skill development that can be applied to this high-skill high-wage industry. Talented US citizens will be recruited into this graduate program, educated and trained with knowledge and skills that are highly sought by industry, and placed into full-time employment. When hired by companies and research institutes, the graduates of the Science Master's Program in Translational Biotechnology will facilitate the development of new therapeutic products, promote economic development, and improve the well being of our citizens.</AbstractNarration>
