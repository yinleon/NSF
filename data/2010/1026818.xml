    <AbstractNarration>This research project examines participation in free software development, with a special focus on advocacy to increase the diversity of participants. While historically participation in free software has been overwhelmingly dominated by men, there has been a recent explosion of advocacy championing gender diversity in free software development. Animated by this contemporary surge of activism, this project asks: Why has such a vibrant politics around gender emerged now? What are advocacy and activist groups doing to address gender and diversity imbalances? How have software developers and other participants reacted to their efforts? The project will present data and theory that will help researchers and participants alike articulate how participation in technical projects broadens gender identities as well as how gender changes technical practice. This will enhance understanding of women's participation in science and engineering more generally. To conduct the study, the researchers will combine in-person participant-observation and in-depth interviews with analysis of online interactions and products such as user forums, list-servs, etc. Through these multiple methods, the researchers will uncover and analyze practices of gender representation and inclusion in contemporary activism around media and information technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A robust understanding of women's pleasures and motivations in making free software has implications for women's participation not only in free software but in related endeavors including proprietary software production, academic computer science, entrepreneurial activities, and other forms of engineering practice and technical culture. In particular, the project's analysis of advocates' efforts to recruit and retain women in free software may provide models, lessons, or cautionary tales for wider recruitment, mentoring, and retention efforts in other scientific arenas. The knowledge this project will produce about gender and software has strong potential to help policymakers and academics make better decisions about how to attract and retain women in computer science.</AbstractNarration>
