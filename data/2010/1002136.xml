    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 0702221&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Hierarchical approximations to optimal control&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: Todorov, Emanuel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI Institution: University of California-San Diego &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is develop new algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;approximately-optimal control of complex dynamical systems. The approach&lt;br/&gt;combines inspiration from neuroscience with mathematical advances in control&lt;br/&gt;theory. The algorithms have a hierarchical structure reminiscent of the way&lt;br/&gt;the brain generates complex behavior. The lower level of the hierarchy&lt;br/&gt;augments the body and makes it easier to control. The higher level monitors&lt;br/&gt;progress and steers the system towards achievement of the common task. In&lt;br/&gt;this way the complexities due to the body are separated from those due to&lt;br/&gt;the task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;The project includes two complementary classes of algorithms. The first&lt;br/&gt;class represents a significant advance in the theory of stochastic optimal&lt;br/&gt;control. A general family of problems are identified where the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;equations characterizing the optimal solution turn out to be linear, even&lt;br/&gt;though the controlled system is nonlinear. The second class of algorithms&lt;br/&gt;represents a practical framework for attacking high-dimensional nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;problems, particularly those that arise in biomechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts&lt;br/&gt;The proposed theoretical developments represent foundational work which is&lt;br/&gt;likely to have a lasting impact. The proposed numerical algorithms have the&lt;br/&gt;potential to extend the range of practically-solvable optimal control&lt;br/&gt;problems. Optimal control is of interest in many fields of science and&lt;br/&gt;engineering, including the recovery of motor function via brain-machine&lt;br/&gt;interfaces. Educational activities include mentoring of the graduate&lt;br/&gt;students funded by this proposal, as well as design and teaching of both&lt;br/&gt;graduate and undergraduate classes at the interface of Neuroscience and&lt;br/&gt;Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
