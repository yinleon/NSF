    <AbstractNarration>Technical: This project aims to (i) develop new, controllable, and scalable methods of growing monolayer graphene films on metal single-crystal substrates, involving self-limited growth of graphene films by the catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbon molecules at the surfaces of metals with low carbon solubility at the growth temperature, (ii) develop a fundamental understanding of the growth mechanisms, (iii) explore the effects of substrate geometry on graphene growth, (iv) develop methods for their transfer to other substrates such as SiO2/silicon, (v) investigate the thermal, optical, and electrical transport properties of the large-area graphene films, and (vi) thoroughly characterize the geometric and electronic structure of these films.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. It is envisioned that large-area graphene films be used in a host of important applications such as for transparent electrically conductive films, for chemical and biological sensing, for nanoscale electronic devices, in micro- and nano-electromechanical systems, and as heat diffusers for thermal management. The project includes a significant program in education and outreach, including research training for undergraduate students and high school teachers, additions to course materials in classes taught by Professors Ruoff and Ventrice, and curriculum development. There is a further strong education component in the intensive training and development of graduate students in a multidisciplinary environment.</AbstractNarration>
