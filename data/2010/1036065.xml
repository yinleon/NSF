    <AbstractNarration>In rapid response to the Feb.27, 2010 M 8.8 Maule earthquake in Chile, investigators at multiple institutions, coordinated through the University of Hawaii will install 20 continuous GPS stations, siting stations along the rupture length by using slip distribution models to widely and most effectively instrument the active areas. Fieldwork will be lead by Mike Bevis, Ohio State University, coordinating with Sergio Barrientos at the University of Chile and the Instituto Geografico Militar de Chile. Data will be incorporated into finite-source slip inversions and publicly posted. The raw GPS data will also be made available either by manual download or in near real-time through satellite downlink. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project are wide ranging. The PIs cite tectonic problems that may be addressed using this broad array, including understanding the coseismic displacement field of the earthquake, which will help to constrain fault rupture and tsunami models, examining the role of stress loading on the mainshock and ancillary faults, observing afterslip and spatio-temporal distribution of aftershocks, using high-rate GPS and understanding the rheological and mechanical behavior of the subduction zone and surrounding region in response to the earthquake. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts include support for a large international collaboration including scientists from Chilean and French institutions, as well as support for PIs from the University of Hawaii, Ohio State, University of Memphis and Caltech. The project will produce an open archive of GPS data collected from this project as well as data acquired by the French. All data will be made openly available as soon as it is collected through UNAVCO. The data collected will be useful for a broad range of domains, including geodetic studies, structural engineering and oceanography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported by the Tectonics and Geophysics programs in the Division of Earth Sciences (GEO/EAR) and the Office of Interational Science and Engineering, Americas Program.</AbstractNarration>
