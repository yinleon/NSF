    <AbstractNarration>The University System of Maryland Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (USM-LSAMP) is a senior alliance (10 or more years of NSF LSAMP funding) consisting of three institutions. UMBC is the lead institution in partnership with the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES.) The distinct characteristics of each institution provide uniquely different environments for students; together, these institutions provide a variety of options for underrepresented minority (URM) students in majoring in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields to choose a campus where their academic, as well as their psychosocial needs are likely to be met, and they can thrive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the USM LSAMP is to broaden participation in the STEM disciplines by groups that historically have been underrepresented in STEM. The following objectives support the 5-year goal of the project: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- To continue the established momentum in increasing the retention and graduation rates of URM STEM undergraduates; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- To increase the five-year and six-year graduation rates of URM and other students in STEM fields; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- To increase the number of URM STEM students who go on to graduate programs in STEM fields; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- To enhance partnerships with community colleges to facilitate smooth transitions and subsequent academic success for URM STEM and other students transferring to LSAMP institutions; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- To promote and encourage international education, research, and service experiences for increasing numbers of URM STEM students; and &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- To continue efforts to institutionalize successful components of the USM LSAMP. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These objectives will be achieved through the activities of the nine well-developed Alliance components that are based on best practices in the areas of increasing the participation, retention, academic performance, graduation rates, and preparation for success in graduate programs of URM students in STEM fields, and will be supported by NSF and other funding sources. The nine components are: (1) summer bridge programs; (2) academic year research and grduate school preparation; (3) formal structure for collaborations with the broader community in areas of broadening participation in STEM; (4) curriculum review and revision; (5) community college transfer to 4-year STEM programs; (6)international education, research and service; (7) community of scholars social networking; (8) student tracking into the STEM workforce; and,(8) continued institutionalization and dissemination of best practices in attracting and retaining students in STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes a rigorous evaluation plan that will provide both formative and summative data to be used for continuous program improvement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current state of the global economy has increased the need to support more students through completion of graduate programs so they will be prepared to join efforts to resolve many short-term and long-term problems contributing to our economic crisis (e.g., sources and use of energy and information technology.) The USM LSAMP institutions have built a portion of their reputations on being able to recognize that URM students have been an untapped STEM resource for the U.S. Putting that recognition into action, the USM LSAMP has cultivated URM STEM students and found that their sharp intellectual abilities, honed leadership skills, and polished professional acumen make these students very valuable assets to the science and engineering labor force. The outcomes of the USM LSAMP will be reported at the EHR/HRD Joint Annual Meeting and disseminated via the alliance websites. In addition, the management team will seek opportunities to present outcomes to the broader academic community through publications and presentations at professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>
