    <AbstractNarration>This award supports airfare travel expenses for U.S. participants in the "Fourth International Conference on Recent Advances in Applied Dynamical Systems," held at the Zhejiang Normal University in Jinhua, Zhejiang Province, China, on 16-20 June 2010. The conference centers on recent research in applied dynamical systems and bifurcation theory, with emphasis on complex systems and stochastic models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting features invited lectures by leading researchers. Abstracts of the conference talks, as well as presentation slides, will be posted on the conference web site. The meeting includes a round table discussion on open problems and directions for future research, a report from which will be published in the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Dynamical Systems Magazine (DSWeb; http://www.dynamicalsystems.org/).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference brings together experts and junior researchers in applied and random dynamical systems and bifurcation theory, and it serves as a venue for developing communication and establishing collaborative research among research groups from the U.S., China, Japan, and other countries. Priority for travel funds is given to graduate students, postdocs, junior mathematicians, women and minorities, and researchers without other sources of support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://jxshix.people.wm.edu/2010jinhua/</AbstractNarration>
