    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12) "Threading Flavones through the Undergraduate Chemistry Laboratory Curriculum" is a project led by the Georgia Institute of Technology in collaboration with a variety of other colleges and universities to develop a model for the integration of learning across the chemistry laboratory curriculum. A set of interconnected learning activities called "threads" are being developed and implemented in laboratory courses from the sophomore to senior levels. Flavones are the central class of molecules for this proof-of-concept study because students can learn about their chemical diversity, relevant synthesis, biological reactivity, and interesting chemical properties in appropriate laboratory courses throughout the curriculum. This project is testing the hypothesis that teaching undergraduate chemistry using "threads" will promote: (i) retention of key concepts throughout the curriculum, (ii) critical thinking, (iii) technical skills development, (iv) collaborative problem solving, and (v) appreciation of the relevancy of chemical concepts to human health. Incorporation of "threads" throughout the curriculum is placing the practice of science in a new perspective for many undergraduate students, allowing them to retain more content from previous classes and improving their overall engagement in the learning experience. Two of the major benefits of this project are the preparation of a database of educational resources, particularly for institutions that lack costly, major instrumental facilities such as mass spectrometers and NMRs, and three faculty development workshops to aid in the dissemination of this project to other institutions.</AbstractNarration>
