    <AbstractNarration>Objective: We propose novel silicon nanowire device concepts that show the potential to efficiently emit light of various wavelengths. The underlying device physics that makes efficient photon emission theoretically possible is the direct bandgap of the nanowires and the short radiative recombination life-times. The tuning of emitted wavelength by applying reversible mechanical strain on nanowires is investigated. The proposed research involves a close interplay between fabrication, modeling and theory to realize tunable light emission from silicon nanowires by using the silicon-on-insulator platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in gaining fundamental knowledge of the role of strain in tuning the optoelectronic response of silicon nanowires. While challenging, the realization of the proposed devices will offer an unique dimension allowing for the incorporation of strain in nanowires to yield the much desired optoelectronic response on silicon platform. The proposed pathways to engineer the optoelectronic response is also of basic importance to silicon based photovoltaics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad impact: The proposed research has potential to permeate the fields of communication, medicine, defense and energy. End applications include lidars, imaging of tissue, light sources and photovoltaics. The training of graduate and undergraduate students in using silicon technology for applications that are fertile growth areas in the semiconductor industry is an integral part of this work. The topics of electromechanical properties of nanowires and the use of the silicon-on-insulator platform to create nanodevices will be introduced in undergraduate and graduate level nanotechnology courses. Our outreach activities will focus on low income K-12 students and the training of women and minority undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
