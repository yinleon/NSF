    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to explore the performance and realization of compact, potentially low-cost, integrated terahertz (THz)-frequency imaging systems based on heterostructure backward diodes (HBDs) as the detection technology. The approach is to leverage the unique properties of HBDs - record high sensitivity, low noise, and room-temperature operation - integrated with planar antennas for high-performance imaging systems in this frequency range. Integration and interaction of these components will be explored, including detailed design and simulation, development, and experimental demonstration of prototype imaging systems operating in the sub-millimeter-wave through THz regimes. To maximize resolution, a quasi-optical reverse-microscope configuration will be pursued.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program's intellectual merit centers on the challenges and opportunities afforded by co-integrating these devices for imaging systems. The need for high spatial resolution with a compact footprint dictates novel approaches to imager design; the trade-offs and interactions between component performance, layout, and physical implementation provide an ideal test-bed for evaluating integration concepts. Advances in THz device and integration technology are also expected. Insights gained may also find application in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems and other contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include contributions in both education and the creation of new engineering knowledge. The system design concepts will have impact on a range of disciplines; sub-millimeter-wave and THz imaging has applications in medical diagnostics, environmental and hazard sensing, and homeland security. In terms of education, the graduate students will participate in an integrated program of design, development, and prototyping, with exceptional breadth in the important area of integrated system design. Undergraduates will also be involved through summer and honors thesis research.</AbstractNarration>
