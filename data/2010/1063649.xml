    <AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator proposes a series of field courses for teenage young women with the theme of Glaciers, Climate, and the Alpine Landscape to provide them with an immersion-science experience that has four goals for students:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;?to increase young women?s interest in pursuing science as a career&lt;br/&gt;?to create life-long advocates for the scientific process &lt;br/&gt;?to teach critical thinking skills &lt;br/&gt;?to enhance their leadership self-confidence so that they have a higher likelihood of becoming&lt;br/&gt;community leaders in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This series of courses will build on a highly successful program, Girls on Ice (http://girlsonice.org), which the PI has been leading for nearly 10 years and which provides young women with strong, female role models; with an opportunity to see what a career in the Earth sciences is like; with one-on-one interactions with scientists; with facilitated discussions on the value of Earth science in societal issues; and with challenges that will build their self-confidence in multiple ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To ensure that the young women who experience Girls on Ice maintain their new self-confidence and inspiration, the PI will create a peer-mentoring program (primarily through on-line methods) such that older Girls on Ice participants can mentor younger ones through their last years of high school and entering college. Participants will also be required to give a presentation and lead a discussion with young women at their high school after they return. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the PI will lead two graduate student workshops to provide training and experience&lt;br/&gt;in field teaching. The graduate students who participate will not only have opportunities to lead Girls on&lt;br/&gt;Ice and Alaska Summer Research Academy courses, but also will give them valuable skills for their&lt;br/&gt;future academic career. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal includes a formal program evaluation and assessment that includes a four-year longitudinal study of one cohort of Girls on Ice participants as they go through the transitional period at the end of high school.</AbstractNarration>
