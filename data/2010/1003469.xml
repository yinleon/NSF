    <AbstractNarration>In response to the rapid implementation of a variety of new geospatially-based technologies into the agricultural sector, this project is improving a number of existing technical agriculture programs by integrating real-time sensor and monitor technologies into teaching curricula through context-based experiential learning. The project is developing an information-enhanced, technologically-advanced agricultural outdoor laboratory at the institution's working farm that is serving as a focal point for integrating a variety of courses in the curriculum. Instead of implementing geospatially-based sensor and monitor technologies independently within each discipline, information from a variety of disciplines is being integrated through activities that are utilizing the newly installed technologies. These are generating system-level information that is providing students with decision making and planning experiences. The project is providing expanded student participation in contextual technology projects, developing and integrating new courses that incorporate sensor and monitor technologies into existing agricultural education programs, and training faculty to understand and utilize these new technologies. The project is enhancing the agricultural workforce by producing technologically adept graduates who are bringing innovative technologies and skills to employers. Moreover, the project is providing an improved pathway for highly-trained transfer students who wish to continue their education at a four-year institution, providing opportunities to develop and maintain strong cross-disciplinary interactions among faculty, and recruiting students from traditionally under-served rural populations into technological fields. Project development and ultimate success are being informed and enabled by a strong formative evaluation component, and summative evaluation results are being presented at national agricultural education meetings and shared with others via the ATE AgroKnowledge Center.</AbstractNarration>
