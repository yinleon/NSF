    <AbstractNarration>First International Meeting of the American Mathematical Society (AMS) and La Sociedad de Matemática de Chile (SOMACHI) will take place in Pucón, Chile on December 15-18, 2010. This grant will fund the travel and subsistence expenses of eleven U.S.-based mathematicians (nine early-career and two senior mathematicians) to attend this Joint International Meeting, with the object of forming longer-term north-south research collaborations in mathematics. All of the funded mathematicians will participate actively in the mathematical agenda of the meeting; the two senior mathematicians will also serve as mentors for research teams. The amount of each travel grant will be US$2,600. The American Mathematical Society will administer the grant, and requests US$60 per travel grant to cover its administrative costs. The total amount of the grant is US$29,260. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be overseen by Professor Herb Clemens of Ohio State University and Professor Rubí E. Rodríguez of Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile in consultation with the AMS-SOMACHI program committee. Professors Clemens and Rodríguez will form six research teams, with each research team consisting of a senior mentor, one to two younger mathematicians (advanced graduate students or young professionals) based in Latin America and one to two younger mathematicians (advanced graduate students or young professionals) based in the U.S. Each research team will be brought together around a research problem of common interest related to one of the Special Sessions at the Joint International Meeting in Chile. Team mentors will be asked to frame the continuing contact and collaboration of his/her research team throughout 2011. Outcomes will include both research and advanced expository publications. This project will be a vehicle for strengthening longer-term research relations between the Latin American and U. S. mathematical communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
