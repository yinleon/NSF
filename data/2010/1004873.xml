    <AbstractNarration>1004873&lt;br/&gt;Oleynik&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Applied Physics aims to provide high quality motivational research experiences in four thrust areas including materials physics, atomic, molecular &amp; optical physics/sensors, biomedical/biophysics, and computational physics. Each year, ten undergraduate students will work closely with faculty mentors on the individual research projects that are specifically designed taking into account the limited research experience of REU students. The research experiences are enriched by a special professional development program to facilitate learning of research methods, laboratory skills, critical thinking, organizational, oral and written communication skills including: (i) extensive research training in experimental and computational techniques during the first week of the program; (ii) weekly REU-wide seminar programs; (iii) a weekly lecture series ?Advances in Applied Physics? and lab tours given by participating REU faculty; (iv) workshops on the development of oral and communication skills; (v) workshops on preparing for graduate school; (vi) the REU symposium at the end of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants will be exposed to the interdisciplinary interactions between different research groups and will be involved in teamwork within individual research groups. In addition, an enjoyable and meaningful social and cultural program for REU students is organized with participation of USF students and faculty. The program aims at attracting undergraduates that have limited possibility to be involved in full-scale research activities in their home institutions, including students from predominantly undergraduate institutions, and groups underrepresented in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
