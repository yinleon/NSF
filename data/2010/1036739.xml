    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC) proposes to conduct a three-year research project that seeks to understand opportunities for STEM advancement for women through community college education. The goal is to identify the individual and institutional factors that contribute to women's successful recruitment, progress, and completion of community college STEM degrees and certificates. The researchers will examine data from the Beginning Post-Secondary Surveys (BPS) from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and will conduct case studies of four STEM community college programs (two terminal associate degree programs and two transfer degree programs) at two STEM-rich and supported community colleges. While women?s experiences in four-year and graduate STEM programs have been extensively analyzed, the experiences of women in STEM community college programs remains under-examined. Theories such as student engagement, life course, and gender schema, which have been developed to understand women's underrepresentation in four-year STEM programs, may apply differently in the community college STEM context where students are older, non-residential, from lower income families, and more likely to work compared with students who begin college in a four-year institution. Further, institutional systems of support for STEM community college education have not been adequately studied. Quantitative research proposed in this project will provide a comprehensive look at women's and men's experiences in STEM community college education while testing hypotheses concerning student engagement, life course, and gender schema theories of gender differences in STEM education. The case study research will additionally provide analysis of the policies, programs, and practices that support STEM community college education and the extent to which these institutional supports meet women's needs. While the quantitative research will identify the factors that contribute to progress through community college STEM and differences for men and women, the qualitative analysis will explore why these gender differences persist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Community colleges often lack the resources and staffing to conduct the institutional and program effectiveness research required to understand, evaluate, and strengthen systems of support for women's and men's STEM education. By delineating what is working and what is lacking in community college systems of support for women in STEM as well as the factors that predict STEM community college progress, this research will identify areas for educators and administrators to best allocate scarce resources for program, practice, and policy development. Furthermore, the student survey and focus group protocol developed through the research to gauge student engagement in STEM community college programs and how assessments vary by gender may be used as a piloted tool to measure the effectiveness of STEM support on community college campuses. The interview protocols may also serve as a piloted tool to measure the effectiveness of systems of support for women?s STEM education.</AbstractNarration>
