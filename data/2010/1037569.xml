    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this EAGER project is to develop a novel multifunctional cellular metacomposite with interplay between a cellular composite and metamaterial response through microstructure design. As a superior lightweight, thin and strong structural material, the metacomposite will simultaneously serve to attenuate low frequency noise (LFN) and low frequency vibration (LFV), and convert hazardous LFN and LFV energy into usable electric energy through the piezoelectric effect. The study will provide a theoretical foundation to evaluate acoustic metamaterials and understand microstructure mechanism. If successful, the theory and approaches in this research will lead to industrial engineering applications. The proposed design also promises to accelerate acoustic multifunctional metacomposites for energy harvesting, which is cheap, clean and very efficient. Practical engineering applications of metamaterials are still in the conceptual stage and no real acoustic cellular metacomposite have been developed. This is a high-risk, but potentially high impact study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject of this research is of fundamental interest to acoustic metamaterials and novel functional material design. This research will provide a new paradigm for design of mechanical systems such as low-frequency vibration suppression, low-frequency noise filter and green energy harvesting. The research allows students to integrate analytical, numerical and experimental approaches into their education and research programs, which will significantly contribute to the independent research career of the trainees. This work will have deep and lasting educational and outreach benefits to UALR and the surrounding region.</AbstractNarration>
