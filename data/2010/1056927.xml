    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program and the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division supports research and educational activities of Professor Md. Alamgir Hossain of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Jackson State University to develop new macrocyclic chemosensors for the colorimetric detection and selective recognition of environmentally and biologically important anions. The approach is to use cyclic polyaza-receptors as frameworks for the construction of three selected series of chemosensors including (i) indicator-spacer receptors, (ii) dinuclear metal complexes with redox switches, and (iii) indicator-displacement assays. The ultimate goal is aimed at deeper understanding of the factors responsible for selective anion recognition at the molecular level. This work advances the field of anion recognition chemistry by introducing a new series of architecturally assembled chemosensors. The program involves graduate and undergraduate students, particularly underrepresented minorities, in interdisciplinary research and education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational activities are to promote early involvement of high school and undergraduate students in science. During summer months, this project provides opportunities to engage high school students and teachers in meaningful chemical research. Developing international and interdisciplinary collaborations are key components of this CAREER project, which advance students' research capability and broaden their education. In addition, an outreach program 'Chemistry in Nature' is designed to make chemistry interesting and understandable to K-12 students. Students working in the group of Professor Hossain are expected to actively participate in regional and national meetings for presenting their research to the broader scientific community, and to publish results in widely circulated and respected journals.</AbstractNarration>
