    <AbstractNarration>This project will create a new category of intelligent, autonomous virtual or robotic agent, which is continuously operating and interacting with humans - always on - for long periods of time and whose primary motivation is building and maintaining long-term social relationships with humans. The initial application focus of this research is to provide companionship and social support and to promote wellness for older adults who are living alone. For example, during a typical day, an always-on relational agent might play a social game of cards with the adult, act as an exercise coach and help arrange visits or phone calls with the adult's family and friends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new integrated theory of social agency, called SharedPlans Relationship Theory, will be developed to serve as a principled foundation for these relational agents. The theory will be grounded in an always-on relational software architecture, which will be distributed as open-source for others to use and extend. Using a participatory design process, including home and laboratory studies, the target user population will help develop the specifications for a relational agent, which will then be constructed using the theory and software architecture, and placed in users' homes for long-term (month or more) longitudinal evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will make fundamental, theoretical contributions to models of relationship, sociality, interactional engagement and social support. The effort will also produce new insights into how people in general, and older adults in particular, enact social support at the relational, activity and micro-behavioral levels of analysis. The new always-on relational software architecture will be a fundamental advance over current agent architectures, which only support brief, focused interactions around a well-specified task. This architecture will also support incremental extension of agent capabilities and be able to control either virtual and robotic agent embodiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Social isolation is a broadly troubling trend in modern society. Always-on relational agents have the potential to counteract this isolation both directly, by providing companionship, and as intermediaries, by putting isolated people in contact with other people, both electronically and physically. Companionship and social support are also known to be significant positive factors in disease recovery and mortality, especially for older adults. The application focus of this project therefore has the potential for helping with health care cost control.</AbstractNarration>
