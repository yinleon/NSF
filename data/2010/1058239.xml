    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build on the successful results obtained during Phase I. Phase I research indicated that aqueous chlorine can be used as an alternative chemical source for Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs), and was capable of producing hydroxyl and other highly reactive radicals when illuminated with ultraviolet light. These radicals were harnessed to destroy and mineralize small organic molecules and impact the structure of natural organic matter found in surface water. Phase II research will focus on developing a solid understanding of how aqueous chlorine based AOPs can be integrated into overall water treatment processes, compare the efficacies of aqueous chlorine and hydrogen peroxide based AOPs, and demonstrate that solar ultraviolet light can be used to drive this process.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research center around the ability to provide a greener, more efficient AOP which can be used to more economically produce high quality water. Phase II research will deliver an increased understanding of chlorine-based AOP technology, enabling the development of products with enhanced capabilities towards the removal of trace organic contaminants from water. Successful completion of this research will positively impact the quality of both drinking water and packaged beverages. In addition, the research could permanently remove contaminants from the environment through mineralization, preventing unintended release from municipal and industrial wastewater plants. Finally, since this process can be driven using solar energy, the resulting technology will be deployable in rural and developing regions of the world at an affordable cost.</AbstractNarration>
