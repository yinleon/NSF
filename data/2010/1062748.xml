    <AbstractNarration>This award to the University of Massachusetts Boston will provide research training to 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2011-2013. REU students receive intensive research experiences in integrative and evolutionary biology, conducting independent projects with guidance from faculty mentors. Participants gain an understanding of how research is done and a deeper appreciation of the science, preparing them for advanced study in biosciences and eventual research careers. The theme of integrative and evolutionary biology emphasizes biological problems using multiple levels of analysis and cross-disciplinary approaches. Students apply molecular, genetic, population-level, and informatics approaches to problems in cell biology, ecology, and evolution. Specific topics include the control of cellular organization, cell signaling, genome organization, molecular microbial ecology, evolution in the deep seas, and the genetic basis of biodiversity. Enrichment activities promote a sense of community, enhance communication skills, and help students understand broader issues concerning the practice of science. Weekly workshops focus on practical and ethical aspects of research, emphasizing the responsible conduct of research. Students are selected for motivation, research potential, maturity, and ability to gain from the experience. The program serves a racially and culturally diverse student population, offering research experiences to students who otherwise might not have this opportunity. It will broaden participation in science of underrepresented groups, especially minorities underrepresented in science and non-traditional students from urban environments. Students are paired with faculty mentors based on their mutual scientific interests. Students completing the program are tracked to ascertain their continued interest in biology, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the REU experience. The program will be assessed by various means, including an REU common assessment tool.
