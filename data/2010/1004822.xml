    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a new REU site at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Louisiana State University. The intended impact of this program is to foster interest in careers in science, by introducing students to the nature of research-oriented careers in physics and astronomy and by developing research-related skills and knowledge. REU students will be recruited nationally; students can be of any academic year and need not have a declared major, but must have completed the general physics sequence at their school. For the 10-week program, the participants will be matched with faculty mentors based on student interests. Students will join their mentors in active research projects in astronomy, astrophysics, and physics. Weekly seminars and workshops introduce the students to faculty research, to skills development, to common research resources, and to professional development topics such as ethics and patents/intellectual property. Students will participate in field trips and other activities, some of which will be coordinated with concurrent LSU summer science programs in chemistry, biomedical science and other areas. Students from all programs will be lodged in proximity at on-campus apartment-style housing, to foster group interactions and a sense of community. This award is funded by the Physics Division and the Division of Astronomical Sciences at the National Science Foundation.</AbstractNarration>
