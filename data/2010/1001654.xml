    <AbstractNarration>In a wide variety of questions in number theory one often recognizes symmetries and invariance under group actions; and deep insights can be gained into such problems by understanding dynamics of subgroup actions on homogeneous spaces of Lie groups. In several such instances it is necessary to describe limiting distributions of sequences of translates of smooth measures on submanifolds of homogeneous spaces. Building up further from his earlier work on some typical cases, the principal investigator seeks in this project to develop new techniques in homogeneous dynamics to provide very general natural conditions on the manifolds and translating elements that lead to equidistribution of the limit measures. The work should lead to resolutions of some questions on metric properties of Diophantine approximation, counting integral and rational points on group varieties, and counting points on orbits of geometrically finite groups associated with certain geometric configurations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a broader perspective, the research will apply the concepts and methods of ergodic theory and dynamical systems about the long-time behavior of a generic particle in a flow, which is originally a physical problem, to answer questions about deep properties of whole numbers. This conceptual bridge between two very different disciplines uses and influences other areas like representation theory, analysis, and differential geometry, not to mention physics.</AbstractNarration>
