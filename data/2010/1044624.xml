    <AbstractNarration>This project implements the principles of Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) in order to improve student learning in the physical chemistry laboratory (PCL) course. Tested POGIL principles are being used to develop inquiry-based physical chemistry experiments that emphasize macroscopic and molecular models of chemical phenomena. The intellectual merit of the POGIL-PCL project lies in its four objectives: (1) writing POGIL physical chemistry experiments each of which has completed a screen-review-implementation-revise cycle and includes an instructor's user guide; (2) promoting the professional development of physical chemistry instructors with workshops focused on writing materials and implementation and facilitation strategies for POGIL physical chemistry experiments; (3) creating a community of physical chemistry instructors who write, review, and use these experiments and who can train additional instructors after the project is complete; and (4) developing different types of workshops in order to assess the ease with which the new field-tested methods are adopted. Building a vibrant, growing community of instructors who collaborate on generating and using POGIL-PCL experiments is the key to the success of the project. The project's broader impact is derived from the collaboration of faculty members from research universities, small PUIs, HBCUs, and others who have committed to form the nucleus of this community. The POGIL-PCL project is making available a wide range of physical chemistry experiments with training materials and practitioner support so that instructors may assess their needs and resources and choose from a variety of turn-key experiments that best enhance their students' learning.</AbstractNarration>
