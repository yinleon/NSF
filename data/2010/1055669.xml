    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this EArly-Concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to engage novel interdisciplinary perspectives as it aims to study radio propagation and performance coupled with characterization of absorption losses through representative soil mediums to facilitate reliable estimation of permissible underground network structures using currently available chip transceivers. The extension of wireless sensor networks to underground applications has the potential to be highly transformative as it addresses numerous pressing societal challenges, such as condition monitoring of buried infrastructure, improved mine safety, precision agriculture, and covert border protection. While field studies of limited scope have demonstrated the feasibility of underground data communications using terrestrial sensor motes, practical solutions such as power amplification, mesh networking, and galvanic energy harvesting have yet to be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;This research investigates absorption loss estimates derived from dielectric measurements specific to sub-1GHz chip transceivers used predominantly in wireless sensor networks. The research aims to provide uncertainty bounds for simplified path loss estimates and to propose empirical corrections based on experimental observations to facilitate reliable design of underground wireless sensor network topologies and network protocols. In addition to soil parameters, radio transmission factors including carrier frequency, modulation format, transmission power, and data rate are examined for influence on underground signal propagation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outcomes of this project could yield a powerful and low-cost solution to monitoring a variety of geo-structural phenomena thereby improving spatial density of subsurface sampling and minimizing intrusiveness. Improved classification of dielectric absorption through soil-water mediums may contribute to improvement of advanced impedance-based, non-nuclear methods for soil density determination as well as aid in RF-based subsurface imaging techniques. The successful execution of this project would facilitate the use of UWSNs to address national concerns associated with monitoring and maintenance of buried infrastructure. The project also develops a broader awareness of multi-disciplinary science and technology in education and research.</AbstractNarration>
