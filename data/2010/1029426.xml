    <AbstractNarration>This project builds on a previous UBM Group project (0634598). Its overarching goal is to encourage, enable, and support students to do research at the interface of mathematics and biology on such diverse topics as functional site analysis of protein superfamilies, quantitative determination of phytochemical components and dynamics, flavanoid signaling and pathway modeling in Arabadopsis, mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis, and dynamics of cancer progression. It takes advantage of newly established genomics, proteomics and computational core laboratories and, through its support of interdisciplinary teams of mathematics and biology students and faculty, is helping to catalyze North Carolina A&amp;T State University's (NCATSU) initiative to increase interdisciplinary (Math/bio) approaches in their research and curricular efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project is being coordinated by the Mathematics, Biology, and General Education Departments and is helping to expand the intellectual foundation of both research and education at NCATSU. The cross-cutting applied nature of mathematical modeling and systems biology facilitates students from different disciplines working together and gaining a broader view than single-investigator projects. The modeling intellectual focus and tools span the range from prediction to identification of mechanistic structures. The research themes are specifically structured to complement the individual strengths and circumstances of each research mentor. Math-biology student teams work in tandem on specific projects in order to gain experience with mathematical models of biological applications. They are gaining a deeper understanding of the governing processes at the molecular, cellular, and organismal level through mathematical analysis of the overall dynamical system models and various numerical methods and simulations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project is broadening diversity in biomathematics-related professions; providing mutual reinforcement between research and classroom activity; and providing a collaborative network for learning and teaching at the biomathematics interface. It is serving as a model for building curricular frameworks, coupled with meaningful undergraduate collaborative research experiences that attract and retain minority students on a competitive trajectory for biomathematical graduate study. The Mathematics and Biology Departments together are seeking to expand its success by disseminating information about its outcomes to a broad spectrum of other institutions.</AbstractNarration>
