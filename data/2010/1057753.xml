    <AbstractNarration>Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) entails the ability to dynamically incorporate additional data into an executing application, and, conversely, the ability of an application to dynamically steer the measurement process. In DDDAS, the term measurement has been used to connote instrumentation systems, networks of heterogeneous sensors, and embedded controllers. This synergistic and symbiotic feedback control-loop between applications and measurements is a high payoff, novel, and powerful technique for advancing modeling and simulation methods plus instrumentation and control methods, thus creating applications with new and enhanced capabilities. DDDAS creates the potential to transform the way science and engineering are done, to induce fundamental and major advances in the way processes are modeled, designed, implemented, analyzed and understood, and in the way many functions in our society are conducted in numerous broad arenas, e.g., manufacturing, commerce, transportation, hazard prediction/management, and medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unprecedented availability of data from a variety of sensors deployed at great cost requires the development of methodologies for exploiting this data in modeling and simulation. From ice sheets to lake water quality and contaminant transport scientists are increasingly called upon to deliver predictions based on the optimal use of modeling and observation data ? methodologies and theory for such activities thus needs to be a very high priority for research investment. Recent developments in terms of data availability, methodologies for uncertainty quantification and data assimilation have made possible transformative new research. The workshop proposed here will bring together an eclectic group of academics, national laboratory personnel, and funding agency representatives to formulate objectives, priorities, and plans to enable the grand vision described above.</AbstractNarration>
