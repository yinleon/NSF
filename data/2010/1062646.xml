    <AbstractNarration>In an increasingly interconnected world, study of the forces that shape state behavior and interactions is increasingly essential. Building on previous success, this proposal continues the Democracy, Interdependence and World Politics Summer Research Program at the Oklahoma State University. Within the overall project theme students devise and complete independent, mentored research projects on issues with significant academic and popular value. Each year, 8 students work with faculty mentors to develop research projects, gather and analyze data and produce scholarly papers reporting their findings. Activities include research methods seminars, intensive project development workshops, presentations by guest scholars, community events, and research under the guidance of project mentors with established records of research and publication. Unlike most REU programs, not only is the focus on international relations, but the program emphasis is on independent, faculty-mentored student projects, and extensive research training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent geo-political events and the global spread of democracy make studying democracy's consequences for world politics compelling. Key concerns include the ability of democracies to formulate and sustain successful foreign policies, the prospects and implications of democratization and democracy promotion, and the effect of democracy on violent conflict. Because this project promotes undergraduate research into these timely areas of study, it builds on growing areas of inquiry in world politics. High quality student research projects examine critical factors impacting state behavior and interactions, and are disseminated publicly through presentation at the annual International Studies Association meetings, with whom the program&lt;br/&gt;will partner to ensure dissemination and impact for the projects. Moreover, student participants are highly likely to go on to graduate study, for which they are substantially better prepared because of the intensive training of the summer program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This unique program expands national understanding of undergraduate education in Political Science, which has limited examples of undergraduate student-faculty collaborative research. Second, the program provides meaningful opportunities to students to engage in international studies research and contribute research projects to the discipline's discourse. Third, consistent with NSF principles emphasizing the positive impact of mentored research on undergraduate education, the program develops and enhances research skills and prepares students for graduate study and other applications. Fourth, the program enables diverse students from different regions and institutions of the country to challenge and support each other in a cohort. Finally, by offering a competitive stipend, this project is accessible to students from middle and&lt;br/&gt;lower economic strata as a summer employment opportunity that enriches their education.</AbstractNarration>
