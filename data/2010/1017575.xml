    <AbstractNarration>Recent explosion in experimental demonstration of various spin based devices, both from academia and industry, show that the promise of spintronic devices to augment or, in some cases, replace conventional CMOS based logic systems may soon become a reality. This necessitates that appropriate design tools are available so that individual device behavior observed in experimental labs can be assessed systematically. However, for spintronic devices no such design software currently exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research (RiSSC) will attempt to build a simulation platform for spin devices, that is based on fundamental physics and first principles electronic structure but, at the same time, will exploit the increasing computational capability made available through multi-core architecture and super computing clusters. This work will thus, on one hand, advance the fundamental understanding of spin related phenomena and on the other, will enable innovative designs and optimization by integrating varied spin based devices from a common platform. By severely parallelizing the simulation methodology, it will make possible to analyze spin devices from atomistic detail---a feat that is currently regarded as impossible due to computational complexity. RiSSC will thus provide a novel pathway to explore hybrid devices where traditional CMOS devices and exotic spin devices combine to give new functionality. The project also includes significant outreach program including open source software development and deployment, industrial collaboration and involvement of under represented minorities through UC NERDS.</AbstractNarration>
