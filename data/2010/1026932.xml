    <AbstractNarration>In critical areas such as health care, energy, and environment, organizations can get stuck in undesirable patterns of action. Some barriers to change are rooted in individual habits and beliefs, but in many situations, the problem is organizational, as patterns of action become routinized. "Path dependence" refers to the tendency for current actions to influence future actions. It is widely assumed that path dependence causes repetitive patterns of action to become "locked in" and resistant to change, like organizational habits. However, this research team has conducted preliminary research that has identified conditions under which path dependence can lead to continuous change and learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use data from workflow management systems and computer simulations to build a more refined theory of when patterns of action get locked in, when they remain open to change and the factors that make innovation and change possible. The work will consider the inherent structure and variability of patterns, as well as effects of social networks and automation. The results will provide insight into fundamental issues of stability and change in organizations. In addition to scholarly publications and presentations, the proposed work will result in analytical software tools that other researchers can use to investigate changes in patterns of action over time. The project includes a collaboration with the BI Norwegian School of Management, in Oslo, Norway.</AbstractNarration>
