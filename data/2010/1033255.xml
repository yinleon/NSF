    <AbstractNarration>1033255&lt;br/&gt;Falconer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have the potential to be an inexpensive alternative to solar cells that use much more expensive components such as silicon. The fabrication of DSSCs that have significantly higher solar energy conversion efficiency could have a major impact on solar cell implementation. Currently, several factors limit increases in DSSC efficiency and their practical use, such as undesired electron recombination pathway, inefficient light harvesting, and high cost of rare earth-based (e.g. ruthenium) photosensitizers. DSSCs with novel multi-layered structures have potential to overcome the traditional thickness limitation for the TiO2 layer, and would enable efficient collection of electrons generated from multiple TiO2 layers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will explore the structure-efficiency relationships of DSSCs fabricated with a novel multi-layered structure motif. New approaches are proposed to create a multi-layered structure using atomic layer deposition. Furthermore, a proposed cyclization-anchoring strategy will be utilized to introduce 2-D or 3-D cyclic arrays of low-cost, hybrid organic photosensitizers with broad absorption bands into DSSCs to improve light harvesting. The proposed research will lead to better understanding of the structure-property relationships in multi-layered DSSCs, and may open up new approaches for the development of novel structure motifs for high-efficiency DSSCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will provide cross-disciplinary training for one graduate student in chemistry and one graduate student in chemical engineering in renewable energy technologies. At least six undergraduate students will also participate in this interdisciplinary research program. The education and outreach plan will make a particular effort to recruit, work with, and encourage students from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
