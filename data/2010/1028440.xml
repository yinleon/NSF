    <AbstractNarration>An emerging interdisciplinary research area is systems biology. This field is investigating how individual biological cells communicate, both internally and between cells. These communication pathways are similar to a complex electrical circuit, in which the cell communication mechanism is a cascade, with multiple signals being generated simultaneously. Untangling these parallel signals can be extremely complicated, requiring researchers to study single cells instead of large groups or ensembles of cells. However, many of the currently available analytical techniques require a high concentration of cells and consequently are unable to provide a conclusive result. Unfortunately, the few existing single cell experimental techniques require fluorescent labeling, making them unsuited for monitoring cell to cell communication in real-time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of this research is to develop an instrument which can eavesdrop on cellular communications, at the single cell level and use it to study human aortic vascular cells. By integrating an optical trap, or a photon tweezer, with an ultra-sensitive detector, it will be possible to detect the change in the signaling behavior of the aortic vascular cells in real-time. The ability to perform these studies in real-time at the single cell level is not possible with the current state-of-the-art methods. This technology can be applied to numerous biological systems and cell lines, further expanding its impact on biological research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The training future scientists and engineers at all age levels is a critical component of this project. In addition to the graduate student who will be supported by this project, several undergraduate researchers whose stipends are provided through USC's Undergraduate Research Fund and the Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) Program will be involved in different aspects of this project. They will have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art instrumentation and fabrication methods in USC's Class 10 cleanroom and electron microscopy center. Additionally, high school teachers who are participating in an NSF Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program at USC will also contribute to this research. Results will be presented at professional conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals, and the equipment will be demonstrated to middle school and high school visitors to the laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
