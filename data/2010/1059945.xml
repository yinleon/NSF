    <AbstractNarration>The Citadel's S-STEM scholarship program concentrates institutional resources in order to assimilate students from underrepresented populations into a robust civil engineering student development program. The objectives of this S-STEM program are: to provide educational opportunities to socio-economically disadvantaged, minority and female students from South Carolina; to provide an enhanced academic support structure for these S-STEM civil engineering students; and to provide an enhanced leadership development program focusing on principled leadership within the Corps of Cadets and Civil Engineering, as well as developing professional leadership skills. This program provides 23 scholarships over a four-year period and monitors students' progress through graduation, employment and beyond. By providing concentrated faculty, peer, community, and industry support, students are equipped with a comprehensive array of skills needed to succeed in the civil engineering profession. Upon completion of an enriching four-year educational and student development experience, graduates will use their knowledge of civil engineering and interpersonal skills to address society's need for a safe, healthy, sustainable, and equitable built-environment.</AbstractNarration>
