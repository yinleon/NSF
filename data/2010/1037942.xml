    <AbstractNarration>1037942&lt;br/&gt;Webb&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radiative transport is a dominant mechanism in applications including but not limited to: energy generation and conversion involving fossil fuel, solar and nuclear technologies; thermal manufacturing including manufacturing at the nanoscale; fire and combustion, and development of non-contact metrology, diagnostic and sensing technologies. It is atmospheric radiative transfer and its sensitivity to the atmosphere's evolving chemical content that governs Earth's temperature and drives potential climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This award provides support for travel by eight U.S. researchers to the Sixth International Symposium on Radiative Transport, which will be held in Antalya, Turkey, on June 13 - 18, 2010. This meeting has been held periodically since 1995, and is a premier event attracting scientists and engineers in the field of radiative heat transfer. Priority will be given to U.S. Ph.D. students and post-doctoral associates working in radiative transfer. Support for pre-tenure faculty members at U.S. academic institutions will also be considered for support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The symposium will be attended by a diverse cadre of researchers including physicists, chemists, materials scientists, atmospheric scientists, power production engineers, manufacturing engineers, and others who are concerned with a wide spectrum of fundamental challenges and opportunities in radiative transport. Continuing a tradition from previous symposia, it is expected that the most important 30 to 35 papers will be published in a special issue of the Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer, which is a premier journal in the subject matter of the symposium, and of which the PI and co-PI are associate-technical and technical editors, respectively. Efforts will be made to include participation of students and young faculty members from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
