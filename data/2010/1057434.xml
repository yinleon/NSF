    <AbstractNarration>This proposal will enable exchanges between US and Japanese researchers and institutions, and provide early career researchers opportunities to establish international professional relationships on issues related to nanomanufacturing. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) in Japan will fund the travel of the Japanese delegation to the US and cover the expenses of hosting the US delegation's visit to Japan. NSF would cover the travel expenses of the US delegation to Japan and expenses of hosting the Japanese delegation's visit to the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exchange opportunities for researchers are expected to capitalize on research synergies across institutions, address current challenges in nanomanufacturing concepts, techniques, and practices, and form enduring collaborations between individuals, institutions, and countries. The bi-lateral exchange of participants includes a US visit by the Japanese delegation in October 2010 and a Japan visit by the US delegation in December 2010; these visits will include activities at host institutions, tours of facilities, discussions, and presentations of research.</AbstractNarration>
