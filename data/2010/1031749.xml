    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop the synthesis, assembly and integration process for graphene by means of local chemical vapor deposition. Graphene, a two-dimensional nanostructure, could form a highly sensitive transduction system when integrated with microelectronics to possess the capabilities of signal transduction, processing, control and communication. This project utilizes micro structure as the heating platform instead of conventional furnace for on-chip integration of graphene. This approach offers flexibility in ultrafast cooling control to produce graphene with good quality and uniformity. Furthermore, local heating enables the direct integration of graphene with microelectronics in a room temperature chamber while allowing high temperature processes in selective local areas. Placement, synthesis, assembly and integration of graphene can be well-controlled to enable graphene-based sensing systems. This project will investigate and characterize graphene synthesis mechanisms by the local chemical vapor deposition process, including process protocols, heat and mass transfer processes, design and fabrication of microstructures, property and uniformity of synthesized graphene, and system-level integration with microelectronics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The capability of direct synthesis, assembly and integration of graphene with on-chip microelectronics could have a profound impact in various application areas, including advanced manufacturing capabilities for graphene-based sensors. It will benefit the general Microelectromechanical Systems community to inspire nano device development beyond graphene, such as nanowires and nanotubes-based integrated sensors. The synergy of research and education interaction and integration between manufacturing, material sciences and physical transduction principles will be an engine for the multidisciplinary fusion in research/education expertise for the next-generation scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>
