    <AbstractNarration>This award is made in response to a proposal submitted to and reviewed under the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering joint solicitation NSF 09-596. The award provides funds to support undergraduate participation in the overall research effort, which is being funded separately by the DOE under contract to UCLA (Grant DE-FG02-10ER55082).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project consists of basic studies of non-diffusive transport in magnetized plasmas. By non-diffusive it is meant that the transport of fundamental macroscopic parameters of a system, such as temperature and density, does not follow the standard diffusive behavior predicted by a classical Fokker-Planck equation. Contemporary studies in broad areas of science are increasingly identifying the important role of non-diffusive transport. Numerous examples can be found in widely different fields such as biology, geology, atmospheric sciences, and plasma science. The project team consists of Prof. George Morales (PI) and Dr. James Maggs (co-PI) at UCLA, a senior collaborator, Dr. Diego del-Castillo-Negrete at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and a graduate student at UCLA, Adam Kullberg. The project aims to expand and develop mathematical descriptions, and corresponding numerical modeling, of non-diffusive transport to incorporate recent perspectives derived from basic laboratory experiments performed in the LAPD-U device at UCLA. The project will proceed by first tackling simpler issues and sequentially increasing the complexity to a level where experimental comparisons are possible and new experiments can be designed. The intellectual merit of this project is that it provides a unique connection between modern advances in the mathematical description of non-diffusive transport and basic plasma experiments in which the role of fluctuations can be related, under controlled conditions, to the transition between classical and anomalous transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include the generation of basic insight useful to magnetic fusion and space science researchers, completion of a Ph.D. dissertation in broad areas of national interest, establishing a valuable exchange between academic and national laboratory researchers, and promotion of interest in science through community outreach events and classroom instruction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF support of undergraduate participation adds a broader educational impact through the early-year training of students by introducing them to scientific research as a possible career path.</AbstractNarration>
