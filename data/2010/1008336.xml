    <AbstractNarration>The University of South Carolina ADVANCE IT Catalyst project will develop an institutional transformation plan to increase the representation and advancement of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)disciplines at the University of South Carolina?s flagship campus in Columbia and the regional campuses of Lancaster, Salkehatchie, Sumter and Union. Proposed activities include establishing baseline data on the demographic distribution of STEM faculty members and academic leadership, identifying institutional obstacles to the successful recruitment and advancement of women, identifying best practices that promote gender equity with the potential to work both across the university system and at each campus, and examining causes and effects of varying gender representation in different STEM fields and subfields. Activities to build institutional buy-in by involving faculty and administrator groups during the development of our institutional transformation plan are also planned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. This project focuses on both a quantitative and qualitative study on what women working at different kinds of institutions experience in pursuit of career advancement. This project will also contribute to the overall understanding of the similarities and differences in barriers associated with the advancement of women faculty at different types of institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The results of this project could serve as a basis for other two-year academic institutions such as community and technical colleges to develop plans that lead to the professional advancement of women in academic STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
