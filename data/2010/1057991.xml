    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project supports a workshop focused on the professional development of Principal Investigators (PIs) who have active National Science Foundation (NFS) grants from the Ceramics Program in the Division of Materials Research, and the development of a website for this community. The goals of workshop are to: (1) educate PIs about the NSF proposal submission, review, award and oversight processes; (2) provide an environment for researchers within the field of ceramics to collaborate and share information about their research projects; (3) improve communication about research accomplishments; and (3) engage PIs in discussions about the roles and responsibilities of PIs, professional societies and funding agencies. As well, a website will be developed that will better showcase the accomplishments of the NSF-funded researchers and educators in ceramics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: This two-day workshop will take place in early September 2010 at NSF Headquarters. Topics that will be covered include: the NSF review process; the solicitation Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI); NSF project accomplishments and reporting requirements; Government Performance Results Act (GPRA) highlights and press releases; and the roles and responsibilities of PIs, professional societies and NSF. At the end of the workshop, a discussion and survey will be conducted with the participants to inform future PI meetings. The resulting website will link together researchers, abstracts of their NSF-funded projects, publications, press releases and other highlights.</AbstractNarration>
