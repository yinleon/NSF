    <AbstractNarration>IDBR: Solid State Patch-Clamping with Stealth Probes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrical measurements of cell activity play a critical role in understanding neural communication and testing for adverse reactions to pharmaceutical therapies. However, current measurement techniques either cause rapid cell death or provide low-quality data, severely limiting monitoring and understanding of these activities. There is thus a compelling need for a new instrument that provides long-duration, high-quality electrical cell measurements that is easy to use and can measure a number of cells at the same time. The key obstacle is creating an intimate junction between the cell membrane and a cell-penetrating electrode. This research program explores a unique approach to this problem by creating metallic electrodes that mimic the structure and functionality of biological transmembrane proteins. These electrodes are designed to fuse into the lipid membrane, enabling direct electrical access into the cell without leakage. Electrode structure, surface modification and size will be optimized to provide the best electrical junctions and cell longevity. The final architecture will be developed into a simple to use, 96-electrode platform for low-noise, long-term electrical cell measurements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this work is greatly enhancing the number, quality, and duration of electrophysiological recording and stimulation, as well as training undergraduate students, graduate students, and middle school teachers in interdisciplinary scientific research. The final platform will dramatically impact studies of neural networks, neuron physiology, and drug screening, where slow testing rates and poor cell viability limits the number and types of experiments that can be performed. With this device, interconnected networks of up to 96 neurons could be stimulated and recorded simultaneously, allowing an unprecedented view of the evolution of sub-threshold voltage signaling in neural networks. These platforms will also play a crucial role in faster validation and screening for potential side effects of drug candidates, enhancing public health and safety.</AbstractNarration>
