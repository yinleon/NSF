    <AbstractNarration>The idea that many algebraic invariants in number theory should have analytic analogues forms one of the central themes of arithmetic geometry today. Iwasawa theory takes this theme a step further, insisting that certain p-adic limits of algebraic invariants should have p-adic analytic relatives, an idea that has proven very fruitful. The PIs are organizing the conference Iwasawa 2010 at the University of Toronto from July 5-9, 2010, in coordination with the Fields Institute. This conference is the latest in a biannual series of international conferences on Iwasawa theory, and the first to be held in North America. The series has consistently attracted a worldwide audience, and speakers are invited upon consultation with a distinguished scientific committee. The award will provide travel support for U.S. speakers and junior researchers to the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number theory attempts to answer fundamental questions in arithmetic, such as: what are the solutions to a given polynomial equation? Iwasawa theory is a major area of research in number theory that provides, among other things, a means of relating the solutions of certain such equations to interesting mathematical functions (known as p-adic L-functions). The award will provide travel support for U.S. mathematicians to the international conference Iwasawa 2010 organized at the University of Toronto in coordination with the Fields Institute, during the period July 5-9, 2010. In particular, support for U.S. graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will provide them with the opportunity to learn from some of the foremost experts in the field. Moreover, the conference will educate the experts on new techniques and developments in Iwasawa theory, thereby promoting even greater progress on its many open problems and new directions of research.</AbstractNarration>
