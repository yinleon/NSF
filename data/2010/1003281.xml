    <AbstractNarration>SES#: 1003281&lt;br/&gt;PI: Linda D. Molm&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Scott V. Savage&lt;br/&gt;University of Arizona&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project tests whether two types of social exchanges (reciprocal and negotiated) differentially affect the likelihood of actors exiting a social network in order to join a new social network and whether structural inequalities affect such choices. Reciprocal exchanges involve an actor deciding to initiate an exchange by providing benefits to another without knowing whether the other will reciprocate. Negotiated exchanges involve actors bargaining over the terms of an exchange. An experiment will be conducted to test whether exchanging in a social network characterized by reciprocal exchanges compared to negotiated exchanges make actors less likely to leave their existing networks for an uncertain alternative social network. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This research has the potential to generate results that are of valuable to organizations. Turnover can be costly for employers, and many employers actively try to improve employee retention rates. If the two types of interaction studied differentially affect whether people choose to leave their existing social networks in order to interact with people in a new social network, there will be evidence to suggest that one way managers might improve employee retention is by implementing policies and structures that advocate one form of exchange or interaction over the other.</AbstractNarration>
