    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0707150&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Todor Milanov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long term goal of these projects is to understand the&lt;br/&gt;topology of moduli spaces of holomorphic curves in symplectic&lt;br/&gt;manifolds in terms of the theory of integrable systems. The&lt;br/&gt;first project aims to construct an integrable hierarchy which&lt;br/&gt;governs the topology of the moduli spaces of degree d stable&lt;br/&gt;holomorphic maps from a genus-g, nodal Riemann surface to a&lt;br/&gt;variety X which is assumed to be a toric complete intersection.&lt;br/&gt;The topological information is encoded in a formal power series&lt;br/&gt;called the total descendant potential of the toric variety, and&lt;br/&gt;the goal is to show that this potential is a solution to an&lt;br/&gt;integrable hierarchy. The second project in this research&lt;br/&gt;program is dedicated to an interaction of integrable systems with&lt;br/&gt;symplectic field theory of a compact Kaehler manifold Y,&lt;br/&gt;developing a potential related to the total descendant potential&lt;br/&gt;described above. Relationships are expected to emerge between&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten invariants for Y and for a projective line bundle&lt;br/&gt;over Y, with the relationships described via transformations of&lt;br/&gt;integrable systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic geometry is the structure underlying the Hamiltonian&lt;br/&gt;formalism of classical mechanics, in which the behavior of a&lt;br/&gt;mechanical system is determined by an energy-like function.&lt;br/&gt;Geometric spaces carrying such structures can be high-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;and structurally complicated, and much recent work in the area is&lt;br/&gt;devoted to exploring symplectic structures through associated&lt;br/&gt;spaces of well-imbedded two-dimensional subsurfaces of them.&lt;br/&gt;Two-dimensional surfaces have been studied for more than 150&lt;br/&gt;years and our detailed understanding of them leads to constraints&lt;br/&gt;upon the associated invariants of high-dimensional symplectic&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. The principal investigator's work explores new&lt;br/&gt;constraints of this kind that take the form of well-behaved&lt;br/&gt;differential equations, the integrable systems of the proposal&lt;br/&gt;title.</AbstractNarration>
