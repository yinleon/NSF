    <AbstractNarration>An award has been made to Fort Valley State University (FVSU) in Fort Valley, GA, that will provide research training for 10 weeks for 8 students, during the summers of 2010-2013. This award is also supported by the HBCU UP program in the Division of Human Resource Development (HRD) in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) and the Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO). This REU program will provide hands-on research opportunities for undergraduates in the area of plant biotechnology and genomics. A major goal is to offer the research experience to students from underrepresented groups. Students will be selected based on their interest, career goals, and academic achievement. Program participants will carry out independent research projects under the direct supervision of a faculty mentor. In addition to research, students are engaged in bi-weekly journal club and laboratory group meetings, seminars, and field trips. Students will develop their written and verbal communication skills, and will present their findings at an end-of-program symposium as well as submit written abstracts of their work. Workshops on research ethics, graduate school admission, and career options are also included in the program. Students also engage in social activities that promote interaction with faculty, FVSU students, visiting scientists, and fellow REU participants. Housing, a stipend, and meal and travel allowances are provided. Students will be encouraged to present their work at national meetings. This REU program is intended to encourage students to pursue careers in science and to foster their participation in research. Members of underrepresented minority groups and students from colleges with limited research opportunities will be encouraged to apply. Program effectiveness is assessed through student exit surveys, including the use of the REU common assessment tool. More information and application materials are available by contacting Dr. Sarwan Dhir, at dhirs0@fvsu.edu or 478-825-6887, or visiting http://biotech.fvsu.edu.</AbstractNarration>
