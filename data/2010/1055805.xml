    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to understand the coupled laser and ultrasound-material interactions in a novel ultrasound-assisted, water-confined laser micromachining process, which combines laser machining with in-situ ultrasound in water. The approach includes physics-based modeling of the coupled laser and ultrasound-material interaction, time-resolved observation of the machining process, and characterization of the machined workpiece microstructures and mechanical properties. The educational objective of this project is to integrate the research in micro manufacturing with education, community outreach and minority student involvement. The approach includes curriculum development by incorporating research results, graduate students mentoring, undergraduate and minority high school student involvement through a project class and an academy program, interfacing with local schools and museum, and teaching skill improvement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project will provide an improved understanding of the coupled laser and ultrasound material interactions in the ultrasound-assisted water-confined laser micromachining process, which can potentially avoid or greatly reduce current micromachining defects. This can lead to better product quality, increase the manufacturing efficiency, and reduced cost. This will have a broad impact on medical, electronics, automotive and many other areas, which have a rapidly growing need for micromachining. The educational activities will improve education in the manufacturing area at Illinois Institute of Technology, strengthen the university's connections with local communities, enhance the public awareness to laser technologies, and attract more high school and minority students to the university science and engineering programs. Research results dissemination can be effectively realized through journal and conference publications, and the interactions with industries.</AbstractNarration>
