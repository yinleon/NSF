    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this RUI project is to develop models to predict the structure of RNA molecules from their sequence. RNAs are intimately involved in a wide variety of biological activities. During the process of gene expression, they serve as informational molecules and part of the decoding machinery. Biological molecules, including RNA, must fold into the correct three-dimensional shape to acquire their active-functional form. These studies will combine both stability and structural characterization of RNA duplexes to achieve a better understanding of the nature of RNA structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Undergraduate students will perform all of the investigations, including the selection of sequences to be investigated, providing them with excellent training and valuable research experience. Students from the PI's laboratory have an excellent track record for attending graduate and professional schools after obtaining their BS degrees. Since 2005, eight of these students are attending graduate school in either chemistry or biochemistry; and, eight are attending professional school. The graduate programs attended by the students include Yale University, University of Rochester, Penn State University, Duke University, Carnegie Mellon University, and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Since 2000, 27 of the PI's students have been co-authors on papers. One of the students won the undergraduate poster competition at the National AAAS meeting in 1995. In addition, a high school chemistry teacher will be recruited to join the research group during the summer. The high school teacher will have the opportunity to engage in authentic research using state-of-the-art techniques, methodology and instrumentation. This will enhance the teacher's abilities and experience base and make for a richer teaching and learning experience in high school science classes.</AbstractNarration>
