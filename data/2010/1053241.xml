    <AbstractNarration>This project addresses one of the most significant questions in science today, and that is, what was the origin and nature of the first forms of life on Earth? Currently, the evidence for the nature and origin of the first forms of life on Earth is an area of intense controversy in the scientific literature. This stems from the lack of consensus on the validity of various analytical techniques for establishing the origins and nature of ancient putative fossil microbes. One key to solving this problem is to develop innovative biogeochemical techniques. The proposed project will be the first application of synchrotron based hard X-ray micro-X-ray fluorescence (in combination with phase contrast imaging and micro-X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy), to observe if any trace biological elemental distribution and cellular structures can be preserved in ancient putative microfossils. This approach will provide an unprecedented opportunity to shed new light on ancient biogeochemical processes thereby, providing a greater understanding of the early evolution of life and its interactions with Earth?s early environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support a graduate student for obtaining a Doctorate degree, and will form an integral component of teaching early life on Earth and the primordial biosphere in freshmen to upper level undergraduate and graduate courses taught at KU. In addition, middle and high school science education students from the School of Education ?UKanTeach? program now have an option to undertake a semester of research in geobiology. The ultimate goal is to provide ?toolkits? for geosciences educators to utilize as employed middle and high school teachers. The geosciences education research is a successful vehicle demonstrating the actual real life processes and mechanisms involved in cutting-edge research. Thus, allowing teachers to share their experience with students and thereby showing how real-world scientific research is conducted to explain natural phenomena. Currently under development is a research scheme for middle and high school students that can undertake a 20-hour research project during their summer vacation here at KU in the geobiology laboratories.</AbstractNarration>
