    <AbstractNarration>1041655&lt;br/&gt;Stuve&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The United States plans to use significant amounts of biomass as an energy source. Effective conversion of this resource to traditional fuels requires discovery and development of efficient processing methods for biorefineries. One of the key processes needed is reforming to produce hydrogen, which is then available to upgrade conversion products to liquid fuels. Reforming is especially important in biorefining, as it is estimated one-third of the biomass feedstream must be reformed to hydrogen in order to convert the remaining two-thirds to liquid fuels, largely by oxygen removal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aqueous phase reforming offers substantial benefits for biorefining as a hydrogen source. The question posed by the PI Eric Stuve from the University of Washington as to whether analogous electrochemical routes exist, and would there be any advantages to their use. In electrocatalytic reforming, an imposed electrical current drives electrooxidation of a biomass derived compound to form carbon dioxide or partial oxidation products at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode. Electrocatalytic reforming has not been demonstrated, however, so the goal of this high risk EAGER project is to discover whether it exists. The liquid phase reactions require extreme conditions of temperatures up to 225 Â°C and pressures up to 30 atm and unfortunately little is known about electrochemistry at these conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed here has the potential to establish an exciting new dimension of high temperature/high pressure electrochemistry about which little is known. There is substantial potential for broader impacts in that electrocatalytic reforming could become a new and transformative technology capable of reducing biorefining costs and consequently speeding the adoption of renewable, biomass-derived energy in our society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is itself a broader impact of the UW's NSF-IGERT in Bio-resource Based Energy for Sustainable Societies, a collaborative effort involving the Native American Yakama Nation and North Seattle Community College. Studies of renewable energy are of strong interest among students at all levels. Opportunities for study and research in electrocatalytic reforming will be provided by a new course in Sustainable Energy and the Environment and undergraduate research programs.</AbstractNarration>
