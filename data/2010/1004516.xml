    <AbstractNarration>James Madison University will host an eight-week undergraduate research program for eight undergraduates per year during the summers of 2010-2014. The program will provide its student participants with an authentic mathematical research experience by having each participant: (1) Work with another student on a research project with a faculty mentor; (2) Write a research paper containing project results; (3) Participate in common seminars; (4) Present results to the other research groups throughout the program; (5) Participate in a poster session with students in the other NSF-REU programs in Biology, Chemistry, and Materials Science; (6) Have the opportunity to attend the seminars in Biology, Chemistry, and Materials Science; (7) Participate in social activities with undergraduate research students in the other sciences; (8) Present results at professional meetings during the following academic year; and (9) Remain in contact with his/her mentor after the end of the project. As part of the evaluation process, students will complete the ROLE survey developed by David Lopatto at Grinnell College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant effort will be made to recruit and select students of mathematically underrepresented groups, as well as from institutions less likely to have resources available to support research activity, and our relatively high percentage of female mentors (40% over the past 3 years) should help encourage female applicants. Our program also advances discovery and understanding by the very nature of the research experience, and promotes teaching by supporting student presentations at conferences. The interaction among the participants and the undergraduate research students in the other sciences will disseminate mathematical insight across scientific disciplines and increase the understanding of other scientific topics among the mathematics participants.</AbstractNarration>
