    <AbstractNarration>This EAGER explores whether raising long-term mathematics, science and reading scores will require more emphasis on developing specific learning skills before school entry or in early schooling. Ongoing research shows that attention/executive function, fine motor skills, and general knowledge (early comprehension of the world) appear to be foundational to later cognitive development and performance and strong predictors of eighth grade mathematics, science, and reading scores. Additionally, results suggest that schools are not the cause of achievement gaps, rather, these gaps are present prior to kindergarten entry and, once they occur, schools are not able to close them. This EAGER examines whether the intriguing and counterintuitive suggestions from earlier results are more on target than present-day assumptions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the EAGER grant is to: (1) better understand cognitive development and later achievement; (2) explore early family environments and early schooling on achievement and achievement gaps; (3) structure policies to support higher achievement; (4) conduct cross discipline research; and, (5) bridge intellectual gaps between neuroscience and classrooms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER promotes potentially transformative research in early stages of new areas of research; it is high risk but with a potentially high payoff in mathematics, science, and reading education. This EAGER takes on radically different approaches through a highly competent team of experts (e.g., developmental psychologists, scientists, neuroscientist, behavioral geneticist, developmental and cognitive neuroscientists, public policy experts, economist, and STEM educators) with novel interdisciplinary perspectives.</AbstractNarration>
