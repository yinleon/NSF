    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at the development of antimicrobial sutures containing an active agent that displays broad activity against pathogens associated with surgical site infections (SSIs) and, via its unique mechanism of action, possesses a low potential for resistance development. SSIs are the third most common nosocomial infection. We have developed a series of non-peptidic analogues of antimicrobial peptides, important members of the innate immune system, that are broadly antimicrobial, have enhanced stability, are economical to synthesize and their physical properties can be optimization of potency and safety. One class of these analogues, based on vinyl polymers, appears to be well-suited for development as the active agent in antimicrobial sutures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research include the development of new antimicrobial sutures, as one example of a new medical-material that limits or prevents associated bacterial colonization. The overall incidence of SSI is 2.8%, which translates into &gt;750,000 SSIs in the US/year, using 3.7 million extra hospital days and costing &gt;$1.6 billion in excess hospital charges/year. Because &gt;60% of SSIs are confined to the incision, the use of sutures coated with antibacterial agent will reduce infection rates. Once successful, this technology can be applied to other wound closure devices to augment infection control. The goal is to develop a foundational technology platform that provides clinicians additional resources to reduce SSIs. This technology can be expanded to the surfaces of other medical devices, such as catheters and implants.</AbstractNarration>
