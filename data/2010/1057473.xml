    <AbstractNarration>Scholarships are being awarded to ten first-year students and ten second-year students working full-time toward their Associate in Science Degree in the Cyber Security Option. The Cyber Security Scholarship Program is designed to create student cohorts through academic support services and social activities. These services and activities enable the students to bond and provide peer support. Activities and services include tutoring, study hall sessions, mentoring, support groups, transfer assistance, career counseling, service-learning opportunities, and development of a student club. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Led by highly qualified faculty, the college is the only two-year college in the nation offering all five cyber security credentialing programs. The Cyber Security Scholarship Program enables faculty to recruit, educate, and train cyber security professionals. Graduates work for private financial institutions and government agencies such as the Federal Aviation Administration and Department of Defense. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The Cyber Security Scholarship Program is building upon current college, state, and national cyber security programs including the Oklahoma Center for Information Assurance and Forensics Education Consortium (OCIAFE). It works to expand the participation of underrepresented groups within computer forensics. With one of the most diverse student enrollments in the state of Oklahoma, the college is continuing to work on recruiting underrepresented groups and underprivileged individuals to create a well-trained and diverse workforce.</AbstractNarration>
