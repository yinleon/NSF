    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the REU site in the Physics Department at the University of Michigan. The site will support ten students per summer in a variety of physics-related research. REU students take part in every aspect of the research group's scientific work and social activities, and pursue individual research projects under the supervision of an experienced faculty member. The REU students are fully integrated into the research group and will interact closely with other Michigan undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs as well as their faculty supervisor. In addition to their own research, the REU students are exposed to a variety of research topics and methodologies through a series of research seminars. To assist in their professional development, students also participate in tutorials on ethics, applying to graduate school and giving scientific presentations. Towards the end of the summer program, the students present their results to their peers and faculty mentors.</AbstractNarration>
