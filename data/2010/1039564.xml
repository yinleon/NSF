    <AbstractNarration>This project intends to organize a summit on education in secure software. metropolitan area. The summit brings together a multi-disciplinary group of experts in secure coding to develop a comprehensive agenda focused on the challenges of secure software education. Summit participants include representatives from academia and professional organizations across the public and private sectors; as well as policy makers and government representatives. This multi-disciplinary group advances the current state of education on trustworthy computing and a final project report summarizes the key discussions of the summit and the action items resulting from those discussions for stakeholder groups to consider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The summit provides a forum to address three specific objectives: (1) to engage a multi-disciplinary group of cyber security stakeholders (educators, industry representatives, and professional certification and training organizations) in a comprehensive dialogue about the current state of education in secure software; (2) to use this dialogue as the basis of a collaborative effort to develop creative approaches that enhance the quality of trustworthy computing education; and (3) to outline the core elements of a comprehensive agenda for secure software education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: PIs assemble a diverse group of approximately 60 invited participants representing several cyber security stakeholders (educators, professional certification and training organizations, and industry representatives). The PIs produce a white paper based on the summit that is disseminated through publication in a journal such as IEEE Security and Privacy, distributed to appropriate professional associate special interest groups, and circulated with summit participants. The Virtual Community of Practice is designed to support continued dialogue among summit participants.</AbstractNarration>
