    <AbstractNarration>ECCS-1055916&lt;br/&gt;Brian Jensen, Brigham Young University&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Microsystem Arrays for Electro-assisted Transport of DNA, Proteins, and Synthetic Molecules Across Cell Membranes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to introduce an electro-assisted technique using microelectromechanical arrays to transport nucleic acids, proteins, and synthetic molecules across cell membranes. The approach is to model macromolecular motion near a lance array, fabricate and test the array, and perform injections of nucleic acids, proteins, and dyes into living cells. The combination of modeling and experiments will provide a fundamental understanding of the method and its results. Preliminary data indicate that this new technique exhibits remarkably higher rates of transport efficiency than existing methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The transfer of nucleic acids, proteins, or drugs into living cells is an important research tool in biology and medicine, including immunology, cancer, genetics, development and aging, and metabolic disorders. Because of its high degree of transport efficiency, the new electro-assisted technique will accelerate such work. It also offers significant promise for treatment or healing of disease using gene therapy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research will accelerate biological study, leading to treatments and cures for disease. In addition, an annual Research Workshop will be offered to provide intensive training for undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. The workshop integrates the research with education by incorporating projects from the proposed research. The workshop will include future grades 6-12 teachers, leading to improved teaching of science for many young people over many years. Preference for workshop registration will be extended to female and underrepresented groups. In addition, students from a sister institution that does not grant graduate degrees will participate in the research through research internships.</AbstractNarration>
