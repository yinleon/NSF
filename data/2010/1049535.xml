    <AbstractNarration>1049535 &lt;br/&gt;Wilcox&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal explores the possibility of developing a Nitrogen-Selective Membrane for CO2 Carbon Capture, which is a problem of immense scope and value to national interests. Instead of trying to separate CO2, which lacks the driving force of concentration, the focus is on a selective-nitrogen (N2) technology that takes advantage of the driving force of N2 in the flue gas stream. This technology requires a catalytic dense membrane in which N2 dissociates across the surface and then diffuses through the membrane as atomic N. Group V metals such as vanadium (V), niobium (Nb), and tantalum (Ta) have experimentally been shown to diffuse atomic N at similar rates to atomic hydrogen (H) in palladium (Pd), at very high temperatures, similar to those of the post-boiler conditions of a coal-fired power plant. Catalytic amounts of ruthenium in particular may be necessary to speed the dissociation of the N2 molecule at the membrane surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the above separation were to prove feasible, the longer term studies would involve coupling a H2 purge on the permeate side of the membrane to attempt to convert the dissociated N atoms into ammonia at atmospheric pressure. The dissociation step is apparently rate limiting for NH3 production, and the species that is diffusing through the membrane is the atom. I would like the PI to try at least one experiment in the confines of this EAGER proposal to show proof-of-concept for NH3 generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have great appeal to the student who will work on it. The opportunity to work on such a novel, yet easy to understand project, with such potential value in the global management of CO2 is quite attractive.</AbstractNarration>
