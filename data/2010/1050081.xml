    <AbstractNarration>The workshop, Building a Smarter Health and Wellness Future, will bring together participants from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with relevant US research communities and government program directors to identify emerging trends and approaches at an international level, help define the challenges and opportunities, describe possible major systemic constraints, and identify gaps in knowledge, and variables and levers to support more effective deployment. Discussion will focus on high-speed and mobile applications, social networks, and smart technological developments that provide unique and unprecedented opportunities for developing an environment and services that can help address the health and wellness challenges of our society and stimulate collaboration and innovation on a global scale.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals for the OECD are to determine the most efficient and effective roles for public and private sectors in sustaining innovation and to identify where international collaboration can achieve the greatest value. The main goal for NSF is to gather input from the international community, including international policy-makers, systems engineers, computer and social scientists, and medical practitioners, in the development of an actionable research agenda for NSF in smart health and wellness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-day workshop will be convened at NSF, and involve participants from all over the globe. Plenary sessions will focus on 1) new health models: from technical to socio-technical innovation; 2) turning ideas into practice: paths for moving to effective deployment, and 3) the international dimensions. Break-out sessions will give participants opportunities for dialogue and synthesis. A report will be developed that outlines the key challenges and opportunities that are surfaced at the meeting. It will be widely disseminated in both paper and electronic formats.</AbstractNarration>
