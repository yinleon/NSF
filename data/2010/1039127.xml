    <AbstractNarration>Sustainability on the Border: Water, Climate and Social Change in a Fragile Landscape&lt;br/&gt;(Hargrove, Borrok, Ferregut, Heyman, and Tweedie, The University of Texas at El Paso)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope This planning project is developing a research plan to analyze the resilience, adaptability, and transformability of the ecological/social system along the Middle Rio Grande River in response to climate and social change on the U.S./Mexico border. Key threats to water sustainability in the region include: 1) increasing salinization of surface and ground water; 2) increasing water demand from a growing population in the El Paso/Ciudad Juarez area; 3) water quality impacts from agricultural, municipal, and industrial discharges to the river; 4) changing regional climate that portends increased frequency and intensity of droughts interspersed with more intensive rainfall events; and 5) disparate water planning and management systems between the U.S. and Mexico. The region presents unique challenges in an ecologically fragile landscape, complicated by violence, migration, and social inequities. This region represents one of the most challenged border regions of the world. The objectives and associated activities of the project include: &lt;br/&gt;1. Identify, collect, and summarize existing data, knowledge, and models. This is being accomplished by advertising and hosting an international workshop/conference and inviting key scientists to present results and discuss issues&lt;br/&gt;2. Develop a process for integrating existing data, knowledge, and models into an overall model of the landscape/lifescape on the border, through the work of thematic teams.&lt;br/&gt;3. Identify gaps in information, knowledge, and understanding, in relation to defining resilience, adaptability, and transformability, through the work of thematic teams.&lt;br/&gt;4. Develop a research strategy for identifying and evaluating the determinants of resilience, adaptability, and transformability in response to the drivers of change and for assessing water sustainability on the border, based on the coupled human and natural dimensions of the landscape/lifescape, through a research planning workshop.&lt;br/&gt;The project is developing a process for integrating known and new information into predictive models of resilience, adaptability, and transformability of the "landscape/lifescape" on the border. The innovative aspect of this project is the focus on the coupled biophysical and human dimensions of water sustainability in the face of climate and social change. This project is producing an example of how to integrate science and policy aimed at water sustainability in complex river systems. Students will be encouraged to participate in the workshops and conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significance Drawing on published and new research, an integrated understanding of the landscape and hydrological processes coupled with socioeconomic and political frameworks on the U.S./Mexico border can lead to predictive capabilities and improved strategies for protecting and managing important water resources in a fragile and threatened environment. The results can be used by a number of action agencies to better manage natural resources and to develop and implement improved policies to achieve sustainability on the border. Not only is the project contributing to a better understanding of sustainability on the border, but is contributing in fundamental ways to sustainability science. The results are applicable to many major river systems and international border areas throughout the world. Additionally, the project is building a consortium of universities and other research and action agencies in the region to become a regional 'think tank' on sustainability on the border. Since UTEP is a Hispanic Serving Institution, this project provides an unprecedented opportunity for training and engagement of Hispanic students and young professionals in cutting edge interdisciplinary research and education aimed at sustainability. The project is providing sustainability science education and research opportunities for 'the 21st Century Demographic'.</AbstractNarration>
