    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;This conference is designed to bring together established, new and young investigators in the broad field of microbial polysaccharides to facilitate the exchange of new concepts in microbial cell biology, microbial-plant biology, industrial applications, gene regulation, and structure/function as they pertain to microbial polysaccharides. Presently, there is no other conference that promotes the interactions of scientists from academia, industry, and government agencies in the field of microbial polysaccharides; therefore, there is a great need for this conference. The 2011 meeting will have eight sessions that will cover in detail new topics and ideas that have emerged during this time and will spawn new scientific investigations and collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;In addition to the gathering of the world's best scientists in the field of microbial polysaccharides, this meeting has a broader impact in developing the careers of young scientists. The contribution of young scientists will be emphasized by selecting the best abstracts from this group (graduate students/postdoctoral fellows) for the presentation of short talks. From these, ten travel awards will be presented. The organizers will make every effort to select individuals from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds to present these short talks. In addition, a junior faculty award will be presented to an outstanding junior faculty just beginning their career in this field. At this conference, there are extensive opportunities for young scientists to mingle with the experts in the field in the "meet the experts" session, at informal poster sessions, and during the scheduled free time, which all allow enhanced training opportunities for young investigators. This conference also promotes the careers of women as three of the four organizers of the conference are women and 12 of the 34 session chairs/invited speakers are women. In addition, the organizers will actively promote this meeting to minorities and persons with disabilities. These meetings will continue to provide a unique environment for scientific exchange between diverse groups of investigators in the area of microbial polysaccharides and will continue to foster scientific growth in this important field.</AbstractNarration>
