    <AbstractNarration>Organisms, societies and computers are all complex systems whose behavior emerges from the interactions of components. For example, effective immune response requires coordinated interactions between billions of immune cells with no central point of control, and the behavior of ant colonies emerges from distributed communication between millions of ants. This research will examine how ant colonies and immune systems form distributed information exchange networks. By studying in detail how distributed interaction networks guide searching strategies in two distinct systems, this project will formulate a general theory describing how decentralized biological networks are organized to search, respond and adapt to different environments, and how they effectively scale up to large sizes. The broad theoretical goal is to understand how network size, structure and dynamics affect biological function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to an interdisciplinary education program that integrates field experiments with computational modeling and serves pre-college, undergraduate and graduate students. Plans are presented to recruit and train members of underrepresented groups. The investigators are well situated to achieve this, as the University of New Mexico is one of only two universities in the nation that are both a Minority Serving Institution and a Carnegie Very High Research Activity University. Interactions with pre-college education projects will expose local students to interdisciplinary science in a way that is engaging and accessible.</AbstractNarration>
