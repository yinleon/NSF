    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop efficient multilevel&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for large-scale optimization problems constrained by partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations (PDEs) with additional inequality constraints (ICs)&lt;br/&gt;on the controls and states. The computational revolution of the last two&lt;br/&gt;decades has fostered not only high-resolution numerical computations based&lt;br/&gt;on PDE models, but also a shift from model based simulation to model based&lt;br/&gt;design. The latter translates into the question of solving optimization&lt;br/&gt;problems in order to identify initial and/or boundary values, material&lt;br/&gt;properties, sources, and other parameters for which the PDE models behave&lt;br/&gt;in a desired way. However, in general, by increasing resolution not only&lt;br/&gt;do optimization problems get larger, but they also become more difficult&lt;br/&gt;to solve, thus rendering an ever widening gap between the resolution of&lt;br/&gt;PDEs and that of associated parameter identification problems that can be&lt;br/&gt;solved using state of the art resources; in order to take full advantage&lt;br/&gt;of these resources, highly efficient algorithms are critical. While such&lt;br/&gt;efficient algorithms have been developed over the past few years, they are&lt;br/&gt;mostly restricted to problems without ICs. The addition of ICs on the&lt;br/&gt;controls and/or states normally increases the difficulty of the problem&lt;br/&gt;due to the presence of Lagrange multipliers that have lower regularity&lt;br/&gt;than the solution. Recent years have witnessed a sensible progress in the&lt;br/&gt;optimization algorithms that target such problems, however, it is expected&lt;br/&gt;that significant efficiency can further be gained by improvements in the&lt;br/&gt;linear algebra technology needed during the optimization process. In this&lt;br/&gt;project the PI specifically aims to develop optimal order multilevel&lt;br/&gt;preconditioners for the linear systems arising in the interior point&lt;br/&gt;method and semismooth Newton method solution processes of optimization&lt;br/&gt;problems constrained by linear and semilinear elliptic or parabolic PDEs&lt;br/&gt;with ICs on the controls and/or states. For the more difficult problem of&lt;br/&gt;state ICs, both Lavrentiev and Moreau-Yosida regularizations will be&lt;br/&gt;considered. The long term goal is to develop efficient multilevel&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for large-scale control problems for fluid flows (Stokes, and&lt;br/&gt;Navier-Stokes systems).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project are expected to enable end users of the software&lt;br/&gt; - engineers, applied scientists - to solve&lt;br/&gt;high-resolution, relevant optimization problems at a cost that is&lt;br/&gt;comparable (a small multiple of) to that of performing a single&lt;br/&gt;simulation. Long-term targeted applications include data assimilation for&lt;br/&gt;weather prediction and air contamination modeling. Fast data assimilation&lt;br/&gt;for high resolution models would enable, for example, gaining in a timely&lt;br/&gt;manner a better quantitative understanding of the current state of the&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere around a hurricane, thus potentially improving the current&lt;br/&gt;predictive capabilities. From an educational perspective, the successful&lt;br/&gt;project will help the PI's efforts in promoting this field of research at&lt;br/&gt;University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), and it will allow graduate and undergraduate UMBC students to gain&lt;br/&gt;experience in a research area of strategic interest, which is likely to&lt;br/&gt;increase their opportunities of finding a good position in a research&lt;br/&gt;university or laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
