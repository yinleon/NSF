    <AbstractNarration>This proposal explores effective solutions to RAM scraping attacks in &lt;br/&gt;the context of data management workloads. Recent studies identify &lt;br/&gt;RAM scraping attacks, wherein an adversary installs malware to steal&lt;br/&gt;memory resident data, as one of the major causes of data thefts in&lt;br/&gt;enterprise information systems. Proposed research explores &lt;br/&gt;new vulnerabilities introduced by RAM scraping and develops&lt;br/&gt;practical solutions that offer the right blend of security against such&lt;br/&gt;attacks while keeping performance degradation (due to cost/overhead of&lt;br/&gt;security scheme) within acceptable limits. The research team will explore &lt;br/&gt;realistic attack scenarios, model adversarial capabilities and constraints &lt;br/&gt;for typical DBMSs (e.g., small duration repeated attacks, effects of &lt;br/&gt;buffering and data lifetime, presence of concurrent queries, bandwidth limits,&lt;br/&gt; etc.), design criteria of a risk-aware query optimization that can account&lt;br/&gt;for a variety of disclosure risks emanating from RAM-scraping malwares;&lt;br/&gt;and develop optimization techniques that simultaneously optimize performance &lt;br/&gt;and reduce disclosure risks. Proposed research also explores the threat of&lt;br/&gt;RAM-scraping attacks for the emerging cloud-based data processing frameworks &lt;br/&gt;like MapReduce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed research represents the first attempt&lt;br/&gt;towards a new direction of research , viz. mitigating impact of RAM&lt;br/&gt;scraping attacks in the context of DBMS workloads, that has not been&lt;br/&gt;addressed by the database research community at large. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;approach of redesigning a query optimizer to explore tradeoffs between&lt;br/&gt;performance and disclosure risks represents a significant innovation in&lt;br/&gt;query processing and memory management in the database management area.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, exploration of RAM scraping attacks in MapReduce style&lt;br/&gt;cloud-based data processing frameworks represents new innovation in cloud&lt;br/&gt;security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The results of this EAGER grant will help launch a new line&lt;br/&gt;of research within database security community ? viz., risk aware database&lt;br/&gt;management that balances data exposure risks from RAM scraping attacks with&lt;br/&gt;performance degradation in a variety of adversarial settings. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;research could also make a significant impact on the DBMS vendors and data&lt;br/&gt;service providers in the emerging cloud computing framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web site at the URL:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~projects/privacygroup/projects.html</AbstractNarration>
