    <AbstractNarration>Boosting is a machine-learning method based on combining many&lt;br/&gt;carefully trained weak prediction rules into a single, highly accurate&lt;br/&gt;classifier. Boosting has both a rich theory and a record of empirical&lt;br/&gt;success, for instance, to face detection and spoken-dialogue systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of boosting is broadly connected to other research fields,&lt;br/&gt;but has only been fully developed for the simplest learning problems.&lt;br/&gt;Nevertheless, in practice, boosting is commonly applied in settings&lt;br/&gt;where the theory lags well behind. We do not know if such practical&lt;br/&gt;methods are truly best possible; even for binary classification, it is&lt;br/&gt;not clear how to best exploit what is known about how boosting&lt;br/&gt;operates. New challenges will demand an even greater widening of the&lt;br/&gt;foundations of boosting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop broad theoretical insights and&lt;br/&gt;versatile algorithmic principles. The aim is to study&lt;br/&gt;game-theoretically how to design the most efficient and effective&lt;br/&gt;boosting algorithms possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research on boosting is spread over many years. across multiple&lt;br/&gt;publications and disciplines. To organize this body of work, a&lt;br/&gt;significant activity of this project is the completion of a book on&lt;br/&gt;boosting which will provide a valuable resource for students and&lt;br/&gt;researchers of diverse backgrounds and interests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boosting has historically had a major impact on areas outside machine&lt;br/&gt;learning, such as statistics, computer vision, and speech and language&lt;br/&gt;processing. Thus, there is a strong potential for work at its&lt;br/&gt;foundations to have a broad impact on these other research and&lt;br/&gt;application areas as well.</AbstractNarration>
