    <AbstractNarration>Our research will lead to understanding and control of the dynamics of quantum systems, including but not limited to electrons escaping from atoms, trapped atoms, ultracold gases, and molecules. We use methods for constructing quantum wave functions that take advantage of the new knowledge and the insights that arise from modern classical mechanics. Theory will be developed and computations will be made to describe escape of electrons from atoms in electric and magnetic fields, quantum control of vibrations and rotations of nearly linear molecules, control of cold trapped atoms, and pumping of trapped atoms from one reservoir to another. In addition we plan to use the same theory to study models of chaotic transport in ocean currents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Control of quantum systems is one of the "grand challenges" of modern physics. This research cuts across many disciplines in physics, mathematics and chemistry. Our study of ionization of atoms in fields is directly connected to theories of chaotic transport and theories of stability of dynamical systems. The same theory is used to design spacecraft trajectories, examine orbits of comets, analyze unimolecular reactions, and study transport of meteors from Mars to the Earth.</AbstractNarration>
