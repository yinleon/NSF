    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project is to support eight graduate students in Berkeley to travel to the Center for Quantum Geometry of Moduli Spaces in Aarhus, Denmark. Graduate students will participate in research workshops, attend master-classes and other research activities as well as to work together with their peers in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research topics lie at the interface of representation theory and mathematical physics. More specifically, it aims at problems in the representation theory of quantum groups at roots of 1, on invariants of 3-manifolds, certain problems in local quantum field theory (such as the construction of perturbative Chern-Simons theory), and on problems&lt;br/&gt;in integrable systems and solvable models of statistical mechanics. One of the central questions in modern theoretical physics is the construction of the model of fundamental interaction which is consistent with experiment and mathematically adequate. The framework of local quantum field theory is the main concept behind the standard model. However the framework of quantum field theory still largely remains a mathematical puzzle. Part of the research will focus on understanding this puzzle in the context of semi-classical quantization. The goal of other parts of the proposal is the construction of topological and integrable quantum field theories combinatorially and the study of emerging algebraic and analytical problems.</AbstractNarration>
