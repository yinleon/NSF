    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a joint research workshop on optimization to be held in Oaxaca, Mexico, in January 2011. The workshop is being organized jointly by Stephen Wright (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and Jose Luis Morales (Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico). Its objectives include promotion of research collaboration between researchers in the two countries and providing an opportunity for students to interact with leading researchers and practitioners in the field. The program will focus on topics such applications in energy and health care as well as methodologies and various theoretical aspects of optimization. The meeting will have strong participation from industry and will also include a short course for attending students and young researchers on imaging, machine learning, and energy systems. Mexican participants will be supported by a grant from CONACyT, the Mexican science agency.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to addressing theoretical topics at the frontier of optimization research, this workshop will also consider new computational applications to critical societal problems in the areas of energy and health-care systems. The participation of students from both countries will contribute to future developments in the field and establish personal relationships for future collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
