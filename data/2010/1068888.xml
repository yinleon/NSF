    <AbstractNarration>The investigator and his colleagues organize a workshop on Computational and Analytical Mathematics that features the topics of Variational Analysis, Optimization Algorithms, High Performance Computing, Number Theory, and Experimental Mathematics, all of which are very active areas of mathematical research. The objectives of this workshop are to chart promising research directions in these areas, to survey the state-of-the-art of theory and practice, to identify emerging problems driven by applications, and to discuss new approaches for solving these problems. The blend of topics of the workshop provides a unique opportunity for participants in these areas of research to meet as a group, and the workshop solicits participants at all stages of their careers --- from students to international leaders in their disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop participants explore how new methodology from variational analysis has surprising fundamental consequence in economics; in particular, concerning the existence of stable solutions the theory of economics. Another topic explored at the workshop is the use of variational methods in financial trading. The participants also present the state of the art on using the computer to generate and prove mathematical identities and formulas. This type of tool provides scientists with a dynamic reference source for the sort mathematics often used in scientific calculations and applications. The workshop participants also study applications of optimization in image reconstruction which related to medical imaging technology such as MRIs. Another intriguing topic of the workshop is the exploration of the fractal distribution of brain synapses and how fractals can be used to model real-world laboratory situations of this kind. All presentations from the workshop are streamed live over the internet and videos of those presentations are archived permanently at the conference website.</AbstractNarration>
