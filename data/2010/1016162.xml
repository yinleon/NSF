    <AbstractNarration>In response to the high priority placed on such a program by the physics community, including its inclusion in the most recent long range plans produced by the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel and the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE) are actively engaged in developing a program for a deep underground science and engineering laboratory environment (DUSEL) to be located in a former mine situated near Homestake, South Dakota. The primary drivers have been a number of physics experiments that require placing advanced detectors underground in order to protect them from cosmic rays. However, independent opportunities have been identified in other fields (geosciences, engineering, environment, and biology) that would also benefit from the infrastructure needed for the physics experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A committee will be formed to assess the proposed DUSEL program. The study will assess (1) the major physics questions that could be addressed with the experiments being proposed for DUSEL, (2) how the infrastructure being considered for DUSEL would impact research in fields other than physics, (3) the need for DUSEL in the context of similar programs worldwide, and (4) broader impacts of these activities in areas such as education and public outreach. A published report will be issued at the conclusion of the assessment.</AbstractNarration>
