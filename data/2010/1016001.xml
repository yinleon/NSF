    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop and analyze novel discontinuous Galerkin (DG) &lt;br/&gt;methods for solving partial differential equations arising from various application areas. The DG &lt;br/&gt;method is a class of finite element methods using completely discontinuous piecewise polynomial &lt;br/&gt;space for the numerical solution and the test functions. Those robust, compact, locally &lt;br/&gt;conservative methods can treat arbitrarily unstructured meshes and are ideal for hp-adaptive &lt;br/&gt;strategies. The good properties of the scheme call for further research in areas that are &lt;br/&gt;traditionally not solved by DG methods. In this grant proposal, the PI plans to conduct research &lt;br/&gt;in the following directions: (1) a positivity-preserving DG method for solving the kinetic &lt;br/&gt;equations, including the Boltzmann equations and Vlasov equations, (2) application of the &lt;br/&gt;proposed method to solar cell/semiconductor device simulations and plasma physics, (3) a novel &lt;br/&gt;DG solver for the Hamilton-Jacobi equations and its applications in control problems with state &lt;br/&gt;constraints. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity lies between algorithm development, analysis and applications. &lt;br/&gt;Developing robust, high-order accurate, cost-efficient numerical algorithms for kinetic models &lt;br/&gt;and control problem is very challenging, not only because of the high dimensionality of such &lt;br/&gt;models, but also because of the fact that a deep understanding of the underlying physics is &lt;br/&gt;required. The eventual goal is to produce solvers that are computationally efficient and suit the &lt;br/&gt;need for applications. The PI's work arises from the computational demand of real world &lt;br/&gt;applications. Many ideas developed in this proposal will have straightforward applications and &lt;br/&gt;impacts in semiconductor device simulations, high-efficiency fuel cell modeling, control problems &lt;br/&gt;and plasma physics. The PI actively interacts with students and faculty members in mathematics, &lt;br/&gt;physics, electrical engineering and chemistry departments. In addition, the PI will integrate the &lt;br/&gt;project with the training of graduate students in order to communicate in a broader context.</AbstractNarration>
