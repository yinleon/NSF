    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the Third-Generation Solar Technologies Multidisciplinary Workshop: Synergistic Chemistry-Materials-Mathematical Sciences Approaches to Addressing Solar Energy Problems, which will be held in conjunction with the spring Materials Research Society Meeting in San Francisco, California. Multidisciplinary research is essential for advancing sustainable energy science and technology. Scientists and engineers face many scientific challenges to realizing highly efficient harvesting, conversion, and storage of solar energy. Major advances require out-of-the-box thinking, multidisciplinary and new interdisciplinary approaches. This workshop is designed to encourage new collaborations in which the mathematical sciences are linked in a synergistic way with the physical sciences to develop novel, potentially transformative approaches in solar energy research, an area of much activity but largely incremental advances. The workshop will highlight efforts to leverage the physical sciences with mathematical sciences to address solar energy problems and to develop approaches to new generation solar technologies. Invited speakers were chosen from groups of researchers that have been successful combining the expertise of chemistry, materials, and mathematical sciences to address problems in solar energy science. The targeted audience for this workshop includes chemists, physicists, mathematicians, materials scientists, and engineers. The workshop will expose and challenge a national and international group of researchers, including academic faculty, students, post docs and industrial researchers in all fields of science and engineering to a new way of tackling scientific problems in solar energy science. Scientists under-represented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics are well represented in the conference organizers and invited speakers.</AbstractNarration>
