    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit. Membranes compartmentalize the cell interior and separate each cell from its environment. The general dogma is that proteins form the transport pathways by which specific molecules are translocated across these membranes. However, a naturally-occurring lipid, ceramide, has also been shown to form large channels capable of translocating proteins across membranes. This coincides with ability of ceramide to initiate a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis. A key step in this process is the release of proteins from mitochondria, likely through ceramide channels. Proteins known to regulate the protein release (members of the Bcl-2 family) also regulate ceramide channels. The proposed research is to understand how proteins control ceramide channels. Since much evidence suggests that ceramide channels are rigid structures, highly cross-linked by hydrogen bonding, a working hypothesis is that proteins bind to the channel causing a structural change that ripples through the entire structure to form the channel. This and other hypotheses will be tested using both kinetic and thermodynamics approaches and microfluidics. In addition, the interactions between the proteins and ceramide channels will be probed by mutations in the protein and the use of chemical analogs of ceramide. These complementary experiments will yield insights into the novel regulation of lipid macrostructures by proteins and will link biophysical and mechanistic understanding of cell biological function. This research will also add to our understanding of the extremely important cellular process of apoptosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The work has and will continue to involve the training of students at the high school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral levels. Typically five to seven undergraduates (majoring in engineering, chemistry or biology) and one summer student from a local high school will work closely with the principal investigator. The research has also greatly influenced the teaching of the investigator. His growing recognition of the importance of understanding the underlying physics of biology has led him to advocate for a radical change in the teaching of physics to undergraduate life science majors. As a pilot project, the PI will continue to teach an honors course entitled 'Physics of Living Systems' as part of a new physics curriculum, which will be expanded during the project period.</AbstractNarration>
