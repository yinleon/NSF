    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is about developing an Educational Interactive Hemodynamics Flow Visualization and Analysis System to be used in physiology courses for anyone studying blood flows such as medical or bioengineering students. Study of hemodynamics is very important in physiology courses for anyone studying blood flows. Teaching the principles of hemodynamics has not significantly changed over the last forty years. We propose to develop an affordable system that utilizes an inexpensive version of a highly visual technology - Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) ? to be used in teaching hemodynamic principles experimentally. Using PIV with interchangeable blood vessel models can visually illustrate fundamental laws of hemodynamics. However, research level PIV systems utilize high-power lasers and usually cost over $100K. The high cost and safety considerations prohibit adaptation of PIV systems in the education system. We will not only develop a method to create interchangeable blood vessel models from silicone and an affordable PIV system but also create learning materials and novel teaching strategies by developing software as a virtual teaching assistant for the education process, where the students can develop enhanced understanding of hemodynamics by interactive experiments. This will be an important technological leap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to advance the teaching of hemodynamics. In addition the system has the potential to be used to validate computer simulations, and assess the hydrodynamic performance of cardiovascular devices. The number of animals used for teaching in in-vivo experiments may also be reduced. The system will provide faculty the latest technology as a teaching tool at an affordable price, allowing them to acquire new knowledge and skills and to revise their curricula and teaching practices. The low cost of the system will allow schools with limited budgets to use the state of the art technology to teach hemodynamics to their students. Due to its simplicity of operation, low cost and being highly visual, this technology can be used at museums, science centers and similar institutions to develop exhibits in science and engineering. Apart from teaching, successful implementation of this technology in an affordable and easy to use form can in the future enable investigators to visualize flow in patient-specific accurate blood vessel models made quickly using rapid prototyping systems. Our commercial partner, LaVision, is excited about this as they see a growing demand, and worldwide market potential is $250MM.</AbstractNarration>
