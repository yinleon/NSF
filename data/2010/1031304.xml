    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this project is to develop a sensor-driven structural health prognosis system for reliability updating and maintenance scheduling of steel structures with welded tubular joints susceptible to fatigue-induced cracking. A probabilistic mechanics based structural health prognosis procedure that integrates continuous sensor data stream with stochastic degradation model and decision making will be established. Performance degradation of sensors in long term monitoring systems will be explicitly accounted for in a stochastic approach. The degradation model will be updated using the Bayesian and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation methods. A fatigue crack growth monitoring system utilizing the flexible piezoelectric paint sensor arrays will designed. The system can be used on curved and flat surfaces; it will be especially formulated and experimentally validated for applications on welded tubular joints commonly found in cranes and highway sign support structures. Deliverables include the design of fundamental components and technologies for sensor-driven structural health prognosis and risk analysis tools utilizing advanced digital signal processing and system integration methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research are expected to provide a promising method to assess the service condition and for extending the life of civil structures through on-demand maintenance. Example applications include cranes, signal support structures and offshore structures, as well as other metal structures such as steel bridges. The results will be disseminated to facilitate the technology transfer that will enable smart renewal and maintenance of civil infrastructures. Education and professional training of graduate students are integral components of the proposed research program. Sincere attempts will be made to involve qualified underrepresented students in the project research activities to benefit them from the proposed interdisciplinary research and education activities. Existing outreach programs for high school students and practicing engineers at the University of Maryland will be leveraged.</AbstractNarration>
