    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funds to support travel and associated costs for CANS 2010, an annual symposium that historically has alternated each year between a location in the U.S. and China. The symposium is expected to draw 60-70 people. On the U.S. side, this proposal supports travel costs for up to 11 participants, and costs associated with running the event such as meeting space rental and a/v equipment. 5 graduate students or young investigators will be supported in their participation as well. Letters of support from the Chinese Acadamy of Sciences (CAS) and CERNET, the two primary advanced networking funding and operational organizations (SAC through their CNIC division) in China, appear in the proposal and are described as long standing partners in CANS. The symposium is intended to enable the exchange of ideas (the proposal's intellectual merit) that, the proposal claims, would not otherwise happen between leaders and network researchers in the U.S. and China. Broader impact is referenced as the ongoing interactions and collaborations resulting from this and previous such events. The event is scheduled for September 19-21.</AbstractNarration>
