    <AbstractNarration>1039832&lt;br/&gt;Frey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This MRI award funds a laser ablation system to couple with an existing Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) to enhance geochemistry and solid materials research. The laser ablation (LA) system will allow expanded analytical capabilities and provide new opportunities for PIs. Seven faculty and their students Geology, Chemistry, and Physics will immediately benefit. Currently, in situ and high spatial resolution capabilities are not available at the College; the current ICP-MS only supports solution-based samples. The research agenda bridges several disciplines and the new laser ablation system will support better understanding of: magma mixing using plagioclase trace element analysis, Sr, Ba, Rb, Y, and REE partitioning in plagioclase, trace element thermometry, fission track dating and zircon trace element composition, trace element diffusion profiles as proxies for cooling rate(s), groundwater chemistry as recorded by minerals in dinosaur coprolites using redoxsensitive elements, tropical Andean lake core paleoclimate, barium in mollusk shells - a dual proxy of environmental conditions, laponite/polyaniline nanoassembly analysis, and laser spectroscopy and art conservation. The instrumentation will be used to incorporate research as an integral part of the undergraduate curriculum and to develop innovative, multidisciplinary teaching and research opportunities through the use of state-of-the-art instrumentation. The LA ICP-MS will be integrated into individual faculty research, faculty and student collaborative research activities, and laboratory training exercises in Geology and Chemistry courses at various levels to enrich the undergraduate research experience. The PIs have a strong record of involving undergraduate students in research. Many pursue graduate studies in the sciences and careers in research. Underrepresented groups are actively included in research and educational projects. The LA system will be incorporated into Union?s summer outreach program, which includes youths from disadvantaged and underrepresented backgrounds. Outreach to neighboring institutions will also be made. The LA system will be housed in the current facility supporting the ICP-MS. A sample prep laboratory is adjacent to the ICP-MS lab. Ample facilities and equipment exists for sample prep, storage and processing. The current ICP-MS is 20 years old and has only had 6 months of downtime. The PIs amass over 40 combined years of ICP-MS experience. The PI will use sabbatical to work full-time setting up and preparing the new instrumentation. A dedicated instrument technician will perform routine maintenance. Geology Department funds will be used for service and maintenance. Scheduling will be done on an ad hoc basis originally with an automated system as an option. Training will be conducted by the PIs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
