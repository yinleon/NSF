    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;This project is a new Science Masters Program (SMP) in biomedical engineering at Grand Valley State University. In this program students are learning how to apply mathematics, science, and engineering to medicine and health in order to advance fundamental understanding and create knowledge in areas ranging from molecules to organ systems. In addition, students are learning to develop innovative approaches for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, for patient rehabilitation, and for improving health. This Science Master's Program is educating students to meet these objectives by connecting product development activities and opportunities with research in order to support the development of innovative medical products for commercial use. The curriculum includes: (1) foundation courses in human physiology to help students effectively communicate with health care professionals and apply advanced technological solutions to clinical problems; (2) engineering courses that apply engineering principles to problems in medicine and health; (3) medical device design and development courses to evaluate, design, and construct medical products; and (4) research opportunities employing the methods for effectively translating ideas from concept to bedside.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The State of Michigan is actively pursuing expansion of its biomedical sector as part of its economic recovery plan. The SMP is West Michigan's only program in graduate biomedical engineering education. It is located in close proximity to medical research and biomedical firms. The graduates of this program are key resources in nurturing the growth of this sector.</AbstractNarration>
