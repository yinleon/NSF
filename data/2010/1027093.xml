    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Alan Gilchrist at Rutgers University will conduct a series of experiments to discover how the human visual system can accurately determine the gray shade of visible surfaces even when the contrast in the image reaching the eye has been severely reduced. This occurs when a scene is viewed through a sheet of glass. Light reflected off the front surface of the glass (e.g., a reflection of the sky on a car windshield) combines with the pattern of light coming through the glass, reducing the contrast of that pattern. A bright glare source in the visual field can have the same effect, due to intense scattered light within the eyeball. The experiments will systematically isolate image features that are present in 3D scenes (where it is known that humans can successfully correct for such reflected light) and 2D patterns (where the correction fails). These features include shadows, light-absent crevices, and certain patterns where overlapping edges intersect. In addition, the perception of colored surfaces overlain with colored reflections will also be studied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The human visual system is able to determine the gray shade of objects despite changes in illumination level, changes in the background behind the object, and changes in the media that intervene between the viewer and the object. This latter problem has been almost totally neglected by vision research. A solution will advance our understanding of how the brain computes the gray shade of visible objects. It is widely agreed that in order to determine the gray level intensity of a surface, the human visual system relies crucially on the strength of contrast at the edges of that surface and neighboring surfaces. When the entire scene containing that surface is overlain with reflected light (or light scattered from a glare source), the strength of contrast at those edges is dramatically reduced. Nevertheless, when the scene is 3D and somewhat complex, the human eye can automatically disentangle the reflected light from the scene itself, and perceive the gray shade of the surface correctly. No machine visual system can do that. Knowledge about how the human visual system achieves this feat will contribute to the enhanced ability to program a machine to replicate it.</AbstractNarration>
