    <AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Indiana University proposes to hold an International Research Network Connections (IRNC) Program Workshop in Washington, DC. The Workshop will be held on July 13, 2010. The current planned location is the Ballston Hilton Hotel in Washington, DC. The workshop will bring together key international research and education network service providers and the IRNC Principal Investigators. The group will discuss current and future network developments, future science activities and collaborations and how to work together to ensure that global network cyberinfrastructure is available to support and encourage existing and proposed science collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this workshop proposal is to develop a roadmap for project interoperation within the IRNC program and to expand this roadmap to the US interoperation with national research and education networks worldwide. The workshop will bring together network cyberinfrastructure practitioners with key science communities dependent on that infrastructure in a way that will lead to ongoing, sustainable global scale interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will set the initial agenda for US international networking efforts for the IRNC funded networks and will help insure smooth inter-operation among the funded projects and with the auxiliary services.</AbstractNarration>
