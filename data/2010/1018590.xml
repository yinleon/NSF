    <AbstractNarration>This project is devoted to building a large multilingual semantic network&lt;br/&gt;through the application of novel techniques for semantic analysis&lt;br/&gt;specifically targeted at the Wikipedia corpus. The driving hypothesis of&lt;br/&gt;the project is that the structure of Wikipedia can be effectively used to&lt;br/&gt;create a highly structured graph of world knowledge in which nodes&lt;br/&gt;correspond to entities and concepts described in Wikipedia, while edges&lt;br/&gt;capture ontological relations such as hypernymy and meronymy. Special&lt;br/&gt;emphasis is given to exploiting the multilingual information available in&lt;br/&gt;Wikipedia in order to improve the performance of each semantic analysis&lt;br/&gt;tool. Significant research effort is therefore aimed at developing tools&lt;br/&gt;for word sense disambiguation, reference resolution and the extraction of&lt;br/&gt;ontological relations that use multilingual reinforcement and the&lt;br/&gt;consistent structure and focused content of Wikipedia to solve these tasks&lt;br/&gt;accurately. An additional research challenge is the effective integration&lt;br/&gt;of inherently noisy evidence from multiple Wikipedia articles in order to&lt;br/&gt;increase the reliability of the overall knowledge encoded in the global&lt;br/&gt;Wikipedia graph. Computing probabilistic confidence values for every piece&lt;br/&gt;of structural information added to the network is an important step in&lt;br/&gt;this integration, and it is also meant to provide increased utility for&lt;br/&gt;downstream applications. The proposed highly structured semantic network&lt;br/&gt;complements existing semantic resources and is expected to have a broad&lt;br/&gt;impact on a wide range of natural language processing applications in need&lt;br/&gt;of large scale world knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information, please see the project website:&lt;br/&gt;http://lit.csci.unt.edu/index.php/Mu.Se.Net</AbstractNarration>
