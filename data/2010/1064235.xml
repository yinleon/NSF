    <AbstractNarration>The research theme of this IRES program is the design and testing of microscale air vehicles (MAVs) based on mimicking the flight mechanisms of birds, insects, and bats. Six graduate and six undergraduate students will go to China to conduct research projects at the J.C. Wu Research Center in Aerodynamics at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). The students, with their Chinese mentors, will explore novel airfoil and wing designs that could improve aerodynamic performance of MAVs as well as the flight agility and versatility that are needed for advanced applications. The program will also provide cultural training to the students to broaden their understanding of the Chinese environment and global cooperation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project engages the students in a cutting-edge research area, involving the understanding and mechanical replication of flight by living creatures. The research involves both experimental testing with sophisticated instrumentation as well as detailed mathematical modeling of both structural mechanics and fluid dynamics. This international experience will broaden the students? understanding of the world, especially China, and prepare them to engage with Chinese and American colleagues in the future course of their careers. The development of reliable and efficient MAVs can have technological, environmental and political impact through various remote sensing, monitoring and actuation applications.</AbstractNarration>
