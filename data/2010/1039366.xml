    <AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the 2010 Photonics in Switching Topical Meeting, to be held at the Monterey Plaza Hotel in Monterey, California, on July 25-28, 2010, is to discuss the rapidly evolving technology, in a small group, with leaders in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;The conference will assemble the key leaders in the field to present recent advances in Photonics in Switching and will discuss future developments and applications in optical networking, computing and Internet infrastructures. The meeting discussions will advance the leading edge of Photonic Switching research by bringing together researchers from the different impacted disciplines, to define and answer their emerging needs of the next decades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact:&lt;br/&gt;The Photonics in Switching Topical Meeting has been the premier meeting addressing the technology since 1987 and attracts bright researchers in academia, industry and government agencies. By rotating its venue between the US, Asia and Europe on a three year cycle it offers an international forum conducive to direct dialog, dissemination and discussions in identifying novel directions. &lt;br/&gt;This meeting has been instrumental in defining the research required by the growing demands in internet traffic and for reduction in power consumption and device footprint.&lt;br/&gt;This Topical Meeting of the Optical Society of America will contribute to the training of participating students and the topics will be disseminated through the Conference Technical Digest.</AbstractNarration>
