    <AbstractNarration>The research goal of this Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering (BRIGE) grant is to improve understanding of the effects of riparian vegetation on floods. This goal will be met by improving computer models to describe the influence of riparian vegetation on flood conditions, and to apply the advanced models to study the phenomenon of flood wave attenuation. Today it is widely recognized that past engineering and economic water resources development practices, while often meeting specific project objectives, tended to work against nature rather than with it, and the consequence in many cases has been severe degradation of our natural environment. Thus, several efforts are now focused on restoring rivers to a more natural state in order to recover the benefits provided by properly functioning ecosystems. Riparian zones, which exist at the interface between land and a stream, are often targeted for restoration due to the many ecosystem functions they provide including wildlife habitat and improved water quality. However, existing river engineering methods are in many ways inadequate for informing riparian restoration designs. For example, computer models that are used to predict the impacts of floods do not adequately represent the influence of riparian vegetation when assessing flood risks. Further, it is widely recognized that healthy riparian zones can reduce downstream flood peaks by storing water and slowing down flood waves in a process known as flood wave attenuation. However, existing tools cannot predict the degree of attenuation for real-world conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will benefit society by improving our ability to design stream restoration projects in a way that enhances flood protection rather than increasing flood risks. Such information will also allow society to consider nonstructural approaches to flood control that will not adversely impact river and floodplain functions. This project will also broaden participation of underrepresented students in the field of civil engineering.</AbstractNarration>
