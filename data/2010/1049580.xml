    <AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Peter B. Armentrout of the University of Utah will continue work in the fields of gas-phase organometallic and biological ion chemistry and chemical dynamics. Utilizing mass spectrometric instrumentation, quantitative studies of five interrelated areas of chemical interactions will be performed: electronic state-specific chemistry of transition metal ions; solvation energies of multiply charged metal ions including those of environmental and biological importance; interactions of protons and metal ions with biologically relevant molecules; spectroscopic studies to complement the reactivity studies; and continued development of advanced means to analyze experiments on large and complex systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity include a continued development of the experimental methods needed to obtain quantitative thermochemical data and the long-range, integrated aspects of establishing a comprehensive thermochemical database. An evolving data analysis program is made freely available to scientific groups around the globe. Educational objectives remain a key component of this research program. Outreach efforts include popular Christmas lectures at the University of Utah.</AbstractNarration>
