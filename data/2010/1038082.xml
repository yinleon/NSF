    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project will host a workshop to bring the experts in the area of sustainable buildings from both United States and Turkey to discuss and recommend best practices in the field. The workshop will facilitate exchange of the latest information and state-of-the-art practices on sustainable&lt;br/&gt;buildings design and construction among researchers and professionals in the building industry.&lt;br/&gt;The discussion topics include a variety of concepts in architecture such as materials, water, and energy use in building design, construction and operation. The proposal also has a good emphasis on cultural difference in approaching sustainable design problem.&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will assemble almost 100 invited participants and more attendees from other countries. The scale of the workshop is large enough to include a great number of experts (24 keynote speakers and 24 discussion leaders) in the areas and a significant number of young diverse attendees (24 students). The poster session designed specifically for young attendees to provide a good opportunity to interact with senior attendees in the group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two communities/countries (US and Turkey) with long histories of technology development and architecture design will provide a good venue for exchange ideas for researchers and practitioners from both countries. It is expected that the workshop will bring global impacts and opportunity for future research collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;Further, the workshop will offer an opportunity for the participants to discuss and recommend policies and practices that may assist governments and other interested parties in carrying out their tasks. The outcomes may help the authorities to establish codes and guidelines for sustainable&lt;br/&gt;building design and facilitate safeguarding the future of our natural environment while providing a safe and comfortable built environment for the citizens of their respective communities. The planned workshop will be jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the&lt;br/&gt;Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBÝTAK). The OISE will co fund this project in the amount of $25K.</AbstractNarration>
