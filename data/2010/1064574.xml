    <AbstractNarration>1067502/1064574&lt;br/&gt;Liu/Hu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to quantify the biomarker detection process and solve the puzzle of&lt;br/&gt;biosensor detection at ultralow concentration (femto molar or fM), which is of vital importance for&lt;br/&gt;early diagnostics of diseases. Despite the significant progress achieved in biosensors in recent&lt;br/&gt;years, the fundamental understanding of biosensor detection process and bio-nano interfacial&lt;br/&gt;interaction at ultralow concentrations is very limited, which has hindered the interpretation of&lt;br/&gt;experimental results as well as sensor design. One example is the large discrepancy in&lt;br/&gt;detection time between experimental demonstration of Si nanowire sensor and the theoretical&lt;br/&gt;diffusion-reaction model. The goal of this proposal is to resolve the puzzles of biomarker&lt;br/&gt;detection process at ultralow concentrations and explore possible contributions from&lt;br/&gt;electrokinetics to detection speed acceleration through a novel multiphysics&lt;br/&gt;computational model with verification by an ultrasensitive bio-FET sensor. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;research will not only advance the molecular-level understanding of the biomarker-nanosensor&lt;br/&gt;interface, but also help design lab-on-chip devices for molecular transportation and diagnosis,&lt;br/&gt;e.g., early cancer diagnosis by detecting protein at ultralow concentrations. We will provide a&lt;br/&gt;physical and statistical interpretation of fM nanosensor detection process and explain the three&lt;br/&gt;orders of magnitude difference in experimental and theoretically predicted detection response&lt;br/&gt;time. The objectives of the proposed work are:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Develop a Brownian adhesion dynamics model for biomarker detection process and perform&lt;br/&gt;stochastic analysis of real-time detection results.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Characterize how internal or external electrokinetics such as electroosmosis flow,&lt;br/&gt;electrophoretic and dielectrophoretic force can potentially change biomarker diffusion&lt;br/&gt;dynamics, and enhance biomarker detection at ultralow concentrations.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Benchmark four nanosensor platforms in terms of limits on detection sensitivity and&lt;br/&gt;response time and suggest new sensor designs for faster detection.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Validate the model prediction through designed biosensing experiments by novel bioFET&lt;br/&gt;nanosensors with single molecule detection capability.&lt;br/&gt;(5) Provide a prediction and evaluation tool to help design nanosensors for optimal performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merits:&lt;br/&gt;1. Statistical insights to the nanosensor detection process will be provided through a Brownian&lt;br/&gt;adhesion dynamics approach, which cannot be achieved by the commonly used continuum&lt;br/&gt;diffusion-reaction approach.&lt;br/&gt;2. Multiphysics modeling are applied for the first time to study how various inner and external&lt;br/&gt;fields might accelerate the detection process, thus provide new design guidance for faster&lt;br/&gt;detection. The new design and modeling results will be evaluated through novel Si nanowire&lt;br/&gt;bio-FETs, which have single molecule detection capability that enables accurate and stable&lt;br/&gt;quantification of binding dynamics at ultralow concentration for the first time.&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal of the proposed work is to help develop novel field-assisted approach to&lt;br/&gt;enhance detection capability: concentrate biomarkers near nanosensor, increase binding rate,&lt;br/&gt;improve sensitivity, and shorten response time. An optimized testing platform will be the final&lt;br/&gt;outcome of this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed multiphysics simulation-based method will provide a rigorous mathematical&lt;br/&gt;model of biosensing at ultralow concentration. Results of this work will pave the way toward new&lt;br/&gt;biosensor design. The computational tools developed from the proposed research will be shared&lt;br/&gt;within the research community and subsequently aid in addressing other important bio-sensing&lt;br/&gt;issues that cannot be explored systematically by experiments alone. The education plan will&lt;br/&gt;increase the awareness among high school teachers and students of the potential biomedical&lt;br/&gt;applications of nanotechnology, to advance understanding of nano-bio interfacial phenomena for&lt;br/&gt;students at all levels, and to increase minority participation in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
