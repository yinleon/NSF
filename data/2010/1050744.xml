    <AbstractNarration>This project will enhance the dissemination and outreach aspects of the National Research Council (NRC)/National Academy of Sciences' 2013-2022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey in two areas. First, by the printing and dissemination of an illustrated booklet presenting the survey's conclusions and recommendations in a format that is easily accessible to students, congressional staff, members of the general public and others without a technical background in the planetary sciences. Second, by the printing and dissemination of additional copies of the full decadal survey report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NRC's decadal survey process has a 50-year record of successfully defining the science and implementation priorities for the astronomy community. The Planetary Science Decadal Survey itself will identify and rank the most compelling scientific activities that can be addressed by planetary scientists in the coming decade. As such, the community consensus embodied in the survey report will form the basis upon which NASA and NSF will plan future initiatives. The popular version of the report is an effective tool for communicating the science goals of the planetary community to a wider audience, as it is designed to stimulate greater public awareness of and interest in those goals. The amount provided under this award is for printing, dissemination and outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is made under the Grants for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) program.</AbstractNarration>
