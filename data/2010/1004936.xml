    <AbstractNarration>Harnessing computing applications and data, particularly with regard to materials and devices, is an important approach for solving our national contemporary power and energy challenges. This work synergistically brings together experts from a number of engineering disciplines that share a common goal of using computing resources and data to address major power and energy challenges. The primary goal is to provide more efficient use of resources and a deeper understanding of their role in cultivating alternative energy use and resources. The REU Site hosted at Drexel University provides a holistic view of the power and energy challenges to undergraduate researchers by addressing:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The old: Existing power grid and the computing needs for a smarter grid,&lt;br/&gt;2. The new: Recently emerged power dissipation challenges on data centers and microelectronic devices (e.g. cell phones),&lt;br/&gt;3. The renewable: Alternatives such as graphene sheets, photovoltaic cells and fuel cells to provide short and long-term solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To this end, projects from the electrical, computer, mechanical and material engineering disciplines at Drexel University are providing an individual REU experience to each student while simultaneously educating the next generation of U.S. researchers in the interdisciplinary and contemporary power and energy challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The REU Site serves as a microcosm at Drexel University for computing-based projects in various engineering disciplines to carry out power and energy research. Demonstrated in an urban setting with state-of-the-art research facilities, the students are exposed to the motivations of these research projects and are gaining valuable hands-on research experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The undergraduate researchers are learning the impacts of computing technologies in formulating and addressing power and energy challenges. Computing for power and energy is generating excitement in students and their parents, teachers, peers and siblings. This recognition is positively impacting the recruitment and retention of students in science and engineering. One of the big goals is to leverage an emerging and growing interest in ?a green planet? to promote engineering to a wider demographic at the pre-college level. The researchers are promoting the REU studies (web site, poster sessions and research papers) through Drexel collaboration with over 30 high-school STEM teachers and 20 middle school students in the School District of Philadelphia, and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers Pre-College program.</AbstractNarration>
