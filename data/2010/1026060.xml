    <AbstractNarration>Professor Krzysztof Matyjaszewski of Carnegie-Mellon University is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry for an International Collaboration in Chemistry (ICC) grant to conduct detailed exploration of medium effects (including temperature, pressure, and various solvents) on the livingness in atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and to gain a better mechanistic understanding of the polymerization process. This work includes an international collaboration with Professor Michael Buback of the University of Goettingen (Germany). Professor Buback's work is supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft German Research Foundation (DFG) of Germany. Prof. Matyjaszewski and Prof. Buback aim to determine kinetic information of the ATRP process using pulsed-laser-induced polymerization followed by highly time-resolved EPR to detect radical species and high-pressure online VIS-NIR-IR spectroscopy to monitor monomer concentration. The experimental work will be accompanied by modeling. The U.S. graduate students will spend three months each year in Germany to learn high-pressure experiments with quantitative spectroscopic techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will lead to fundamental knowledge important for improving polymerization processes to better control complex architecture and properties of polymers. It will impact basic fundamental science and applied technologies. In addition, this international collaboration provides unique research environments for training students and postdoctoral researchers and preparing them for careers in academia or polymer industry.</AbstractNarration>
