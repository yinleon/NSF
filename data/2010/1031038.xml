    <AbstractNarration>The objective of the proposed research is to develop a structural control approach to effectively mitigate the wind-induced vibrations of large structures like high-rise buildings and at the same time efficiently harvest energy at the utility scale. Tall buildings and slender towers, being susceptible to dynamic wind load effects, can experience large vibrations. Currently, to reduce these vibrations in a building, a popular approach is to utilize a large mass at the top as a tuned mass damper which absorbs some energy in its own motion and dissipates the rest as wasted heat in a damper. In this project, a unique approach is proposed to provide enhanced structural response suppression by converting the dissipated vibration energy into electricity by using a series of optimally configured electricity-generating tuned mass dampers. To optimize the performance of the dampers in energy harvesting and structural control, the project will conduct a comprehensive study of the dynamics and energy analysis of structures with proposed tuned mass dampers, will design efficient electromagnetic energy transducers for harvesting and connecting to the building?s or structure?s power grid, and will develop a complete semi-active self-powered vibration control system. The project will formulate new modeling and simulation approaches to analyze the integrated dynamics of the electrical, tuned mass damper and structural systems exposed to wind loads. Deliverables include the development of an experimentally demonstrated innovative framework for dual-function vibration control and energy harvesting, including the hardware required for energy harvesting and grid connection as well as the control algorithms required to operate the tuned mass dampers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is multi-disciplinary as it blends concepts of structural, mechanical, power system, and electrical engineering for designing an optimal system for controlling structures to enhance their safety and reliability and, for energy harvesting to enhance sustainability in structural designs. The project results will be integrated in the newly launched Civil Engineering, Energy Technologies, and Mechatronics programs at Stony Brook University through course development, involvement of undergraduate students in project research, advanced training of graduate students, and summer internship out-reach activities for high-school students.</AbstractNarration>
