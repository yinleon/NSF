    <AbstractNarration>ID: MPS/DMR/BMAT(7623) 1061223 PI: Dragnea, Bogdan ORG: University of Indiana&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: 2011 Physical Virology GRC (Gordon Research Conference)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Viruses have many features that are uniquely relevant to nanobiotechnology. To date, it has not been feasible to create synthetic nanoparticles of comparable beauty and utility. Viral particles have been found to be suitable building blocks for several reasons: (1) viral capsids are extremely robust and can be produced in large quantities with ease, (2) the particles self-assemble into monodisperse constructs with a high degree of symmetry and polyvalency, (3) they have the propensity to form regular 2D and 3D arrays, and (4) they offer programmability through genetic and chemical engineering. Combined knowledge of the structure of virus capsids at atomic resolution and the use of chimeric virus technology permits generation of virus-like particles with short antigenic peptides for potential use as vaccine candidates. The chemical addressability of capsids has led to the development of virus-based vascular imaging probes. This feature of virus-based materials, preserving the structural integrity and, thus, symmetry of the molecular scaffold, may also become relevant for the field of energy harvesting. Thus, although there is a diverse range of mechanisms used by light harvesting biological organisms, one common feature to all of them is the requirement of an electron-transfer relay system. This involves a series of chromophores arranged with nanometer precision in a regular array that enables the efficient transport of energy through a series of FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer events. The virus paradigm for molecularly accurate self-organization is under intense study in this respect as a suitable scaffold for the templating of regularly spaced chromophores to mimic a light harvesting antenna.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: This GRC is unique in its scope and complementary to other meetings on viruses. While most traditional virology meetings are dedicated to specific systems, the Physical Virology GRC deals with the existence of universal principles of virus structure and assembly underlying the physical properties of viruses and virus-mimetic systems. It will afford an important and unique opportunity for biologists, chemists, and physicists to convene to apply their respective perspectives to the issue of viral structure and assembly as it relates to use of viruses as scaffolds for the creation of functional materials not achievable by other means. The organizers will use the funds provided to encourage the participation of younger scientists and scientists from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
