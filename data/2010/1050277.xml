    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a series of teacher workshops associated with six future International Linear Collider (ILC) meetings over the next three years. Two of the workshops are anticipated to take place in the US and four overseas. The anticipated workshops will be associated with the October 2010 Linear Collider Workshop (LCW) in Geneva, Switzerland, at the March 2011 American Linear Collider Physics Group (ALCPG) Workshop at the University of Oregon, and at similar, additional professional meetings associated with ILC R&amp;D. The workshops will allow participants to become familiar with the QuarkNet cosmic ray detector and the I2U2 e-Lab data portal that provides data analysis tools and a facility for sharing data from these classroom detectors. The teachers will become part of the e-Lab community, allow their students to use the system and foreshadow an ILC E&amp;O program that will include e-Labs. Data for this program can come from R&amp;D tests or from runs of the ILC. This award is cofounded by the Education and Interdisciplinary Research program and the Elementary Particle Physics program within the Physics Division.</AbstractNarration>
