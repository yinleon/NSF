    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2010. The fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "Understanding the genetic basis of evolution: a statistical and empirical exploration of evolutionary genomics" for Brittny Calsbeek. The host institution for this research is North Carolina State University, and the sponsoring scientist is Trudy Mackay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evolutionary biology is entering an exciting new phase where genomics techniques are revealing the molecular processes driving the evolution of quantitative traits. A major challenge is developing computational methods to analyze the increasingly complex datasets produced by genomics techniques. This project provides a statistical framework for using tensor decomposition to analyze evolutionary genomics datasets. These methods are being coded in Matlab programming language; and the resulting software is being shared on the host laboratory's website. In addition, the statistical methods developed for analyzing genomics datasets are being applied to the lab's existing, large-scale evolutionary genomics dataset using fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). The statistical methods developed as part of this research provide a biologically relevant framework for exploring the genetic basis of quantitative trait evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This fellowship will prepare the fellow for a future career as an independent researcher by providing 1) experience with cutting-edge statistical techniques for collecting and analyzing genomics data, 2) further training in computer programming and software development, and 3) training in the most current laboratory techniques for collecting evolutionary genomics data using D. melanogaster as a study system. The analysis of the Drosophila dataset broadly impact the scientific community by addressing the gaps in understanding of the genetic processes underlying evolution. Resolving this shortcoming is critical if we hope to accurately predict the response of natural populations to selective pressures such as those associated with global climate change.</AbstractNarration>
