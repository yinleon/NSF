    <AbstractNarration>Design methods are rapidly being incorporated into many sectors of the economy and reshaping the ways in which we visualize and understand science and engineering. Focusing on design work at four firms in three countries, this project studies hybrid virtual teams to identify which phases of the design process can be performed virtually and which require face-to-face interaction. In addition, it will build a prototype to aid in collaborative design activities by improving trust, building a social network, and providing visualization tools. Relying on theories from communications, information science and science and technology studies, the research team will use ethnographic observation and qualitative interviews with participants in cross-cultural design collaborations that include design professionals and under-served urban populations addressing issues of social innovation and sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this research, we will gain a better understanding of the degree to which culture, context and environment play a key role in the adoption and use of information and communication technologies to facilitate interaction and trust-building in virtual organizations. Understanding the issues underlying media choice and design is of theoretical and practical concern as the variety of media expands to include previously unavailable social media and as advanced features are added to existing media. A well-developed tool to improve collaboration among designers engaged in community development efforts would be of considerable value to this community. In addition, design methods would be useful to the research planning phases in multiple scientific disciplines to uncover new sets of problems, relationships and models. The interdisciplinary and international reach of this project will enhance its broader impact through significant exposure to and input from a wide variety of perspectives and cultures. The research involves undergraduate and graduate students and will result in their further training and education in interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>
