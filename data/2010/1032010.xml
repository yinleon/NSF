    <AbstractNarration>The DIMACS Project on Computer Science / Mathematics in Service to Society provides a national resource for a large community of researchers and educators in computer science and related mathematical and statistical areas as well as their collaborators in fields such as biology, chemistry, physics, engineering, public health, business, and the social sciences. The project enhances and encourages programs that emphasize applications of computer science, mathematics, and statistics to problems of society involving topics such as homeland security, energy, climate change, health care, and the economy. The project also emphasizes development of fundamental methods of computer science and related areas of mathematics and statistics. This award partially supports the DIMACS Center infrastructure required to achieve project goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research programs enabled by the infrastructure this project supports are organized around special focus programs consisting of workshops, research workshop groups, tutorials, and a visitor program, on topics including Computational and Mathematical Epidemiology; Algorithmic Foundations of the Internet; Hardness of Approximation; Algorithmic Decision Theory; Cybersecurity; Sharing Information; Computational Problems in Medical Informatics; Algorithms and Energy; and Dynamic Data Analysis. Educational programs similarly enabled integrate research and education across levels from precollege through postdoctoral via activities including an extensive Research Experiences for Undergraduates program; a Reconnect program run at satellite locations around the country for 2-year and 4-year college faculty highlighting recent research topics relevant to the classroom; a year-round program of workshops for middle and high school teachers; development of modular materials at the interface between the biological and mathematical sciences for use in high schools; development of high school classroom modules related to computational thinking and to data analysis and homeland security; and a program of advanced study institutes in bio-mathematics for US and African graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
