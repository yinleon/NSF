    <AbstractNarration>Kapiolani Community College (KCC) is the second largest of 10 public universities and colleges in the University of Hawaii (UH) System. A two-year urban institution, we provide high quality liberal arts and 21st century career programs to a diverse population of Native Hawaiian (NH) and multi-ethnic students and communities. KCC bears the name of Queen Julia Kapiolani, whose motto was "Kulia i ka nuu,"? "To Reach for the Highest." This motto sets the standard for the College?s vision and mission as a learning-centered institution. Likewise, it inspires the proposed TEAM-UP project as we move students progressively to more challenging science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) levels. This new TEAM-UP proposal focuses on Life Sciences that are grounded in the NH ahupuaa (ah-who-poo-ah-ah) at its center. An ahupuaa is a traditional division of land running along the banks of a stream and extending from the mountains to the sea that has been a part of the Hawaiian culture for hundreds of years. It provides an intellectual framework that serves as an excellent touch stone for NH students. This proposal also uses key ?building blocks? of NH knowledge, to contextualize the science of Hawaii?s mountain to sea ecosystems. KCC has benefited from previous NSF grants to build a strong STEM infrastructure that integrates the comprehensive, research-based, STEM Student Support and Success System proposed in this TEAM-UP project.&lt;br/&gt;Goals: The project has two goals: Goal 1) To implement a new STEM Learning Continuum that progressively advances NH students, including those with disabilities, in biology, ecology, biotechnology, eco-engineering, and technology; Goal 2) To implement a NH Community of Practice that connects NH students, mentors, and undergraduate researchers with faculty, researchers, and community partners. The project has ten objectives to achieve these goals, detailed in the proposal, and four major outcomes: 1) creation of a comprehensive and sustainable participant support system for 175 NH students; 2) completion of the ASNS degree in Life Sciences and/or transfer to biological science fields at UH Manoa or UH Hilo by 140 NH students; 3) completion of a STEM baccalaureate degree at UHM or UHH by 100 NH students; and 4) new partnerships with the NH community, the private sector and state government, and opportunities for competitive research in the life sciences will provide a strong foundation for future sustainability and growth of the KCC Life and Physical Sciences program.</AbstractNarration>
