    <AbstractNarration>Conceptualizing and Measuring Justice: &lt;br/&gt;Links between Academic Research and Practical Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The term "justice" has broad academic appeal, and the effective promotion of justice is often touted as a goal of policy makers and practitioners in a wide range of fields. Justice, however, is measured and conceptualized differently based on academic discipline and policy orientation. Traditionally the idea of justice is a philosophical and moral concept. But, as the concept of justice has served as part of the foundation of more practice and policy orientated fields, the term has been adapted to each area of inquiry. For example, criminology scholars focus on justice as an outcome of the criminal justice system. International development and conflict scholars often focus on justice in terms of the rule of law and examine particular conflicts or nations in-depth to decide if justice or injustices occurred. Law &amp; society scholars often focus on justice as equity and look to decision-making processes and procedures to measure justice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Justice, Law and Society at George Mason University will host a series of two workshops at the National Science Foundation to advance scholarship and forge connections on the twin issues of conceptualizing and measuring justice. In the first of the two workshops, scholars and practitioners will present and discuss their conceptualization of justice. The second workshop will focus on techniques used by scholars and practitioners in each field to measure justice. The interdisciplinary focus on the broad concept of justice -- which is one of the main focus areas of three of the above mentioned areas of study and practice -- will deepen our understanding of the concept of justice and broaden our skill set for measuring justice in scholarship and practice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will bring together a diverse group of scholars and graduate students in the fields of criminology, law &amp; society and international development and conflict. In the workshops, graduate students will have the opportunity to network with senior scholars and develop their research agendas through the two workshops.</AbstractNarration>
