    <AbstractNarration>Strong pulsed electric fields can induce transient perforation of the cell membrane which enables the delivery of exogenous molecules (drugs, proteins, and plasmids) into living cells. The physical mechanisms of this process are poorly understood. This project is centered on the idea that electrohydrodynamic flows exist and play an essential role in the non-equilibrium dynamics of biomembranes. The fluid nature of the membrane allows lipids to flow within it. We hypothesize that electric fields induce lateral redistribution of lipids in the fluid bilayer membranes, which gives rise to the complex dynamics observed in experiments with model membranes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an integral part of Dartmouth student Paul Salipante's Ph.D. thesis aimed at understanding the shape and stability of interfaces in electric fields. A comparison between two types of interfaces, simple (such as oil/water) and complex (such as lipid membranes), will reveal salient features of the lipid bilayer electromechanics. While the interrogation of simple interfaces involves relatively unsophisticated experimentation, which could be done in the PI's Laboratory, the investigation of the membranes requires equipment which is not available at Dartmouth College. The membrane biophysics lab at the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces (MPI-KG) led by Rumiana Dimova possesses state-of-the-art equipment which will enable the membrane experiments. This award will support Mr. Salipante to spend one year at MPI-KG collaborating with Dr. Dimova and her team. The experience in MPI-KG's vibrant, international research environment will contribute to Mr. Salipante's education as a globally-engaged engineer and enhance his skills for international collaboration. This award is funded jointly by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems.</AbstractNarration>
