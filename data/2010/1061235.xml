    <AbstractNarration>Despite strong empirical data demonstrating the association between network variables and organizational outcomes, there is a lack of causal explanation linking an individual's network position to individual-level outcomes. This project examines the relationships between individual actors and network performance to develop valid models of measuring the formation of networks and their causal impact in facilitating or inhibiting success in organizational environments. The project moves beyond traditional organizational network research involving a single organization to investigate the social structure among more than 500 teachers and administrators from 25 schools in a mid-size public school district. The primary objective is to better understand the antecedents and the consequences of network structure. The network antecedent models will be designed to investigate the processes by which networks cohere. Personal construct psychology and the role repertory grid will be utilized to establish a set of personal constructs presumed to be associated with dyadic choice. The network consequence models will be developed to understand the mechanisms by which network variation influences individual and collective performance. Multilevel modeling and social network analysis will be combined to capture the interaction effects between nodal and whole network measures of teachers nested in schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that the network antecedent and network consequence models together will clarify the complex interdependencies between personal constructs, individual attributes, network position, and performance. The project also will improve understanding of how teachers interact to explore their craft and exchange knowledge. Workshops will be held with all interested schools in the district to discuss the research findings and policy implications, and the network models and methods derived from this research as well as the corresponding R code will be made available online. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, support is provided to enable a promising student to establish a strong, independent research career.</AbstractNarration>
