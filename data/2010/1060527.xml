    <AbstractNarration>This project is providing 100 scholarships over the four-year grant period to biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics students at Arapahoe Community College. The project aims to improve educational opportunities for STEM students, increase the retention of STEM students to degree achievement and/or transfer, and enhance student support programs for STEM students. The scholarship recipients are working with faculty mentors, student services advisors specific to scholarship recipients, and fellow students to engage in a variety of program activities designed to provide academic, professional and personal growth opportunities. The project helps the scholarship recipients, including first-generation students and underrepresented minority students, complete an AS degree and/or transfer to a baccalaureate degree-granting institution. The resulting S-STEM education model is being disseminated to and shared with other community colleges and post-secondary schools in the Denver region.</AbstractNarration>
