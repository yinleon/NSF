    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Biological Sciences Directorate supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Scott Nickolaisen at California State University - Los Angeles. The research projects supported in this site are in a number of areas of chemistry, but with a number of projects at the Biology-Chemistry interface. Undergraduates will be recruited to this site primarily from institutions that lack infrastructure to support undergraduate research, including students from underrepresented groups, with a particular emphasis on community college students in the Los Angeles basin. The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program. A sample of the projects that undergraduates will work on include: (1) the development and application of magnetic resonance techniques for the study of the physicochemical properties of biologically related macromolecule; (2) the study of the photochemical reactions of environmental pollutants in condensed phases; (3) the study of how dietary factors regulate the metabolism of high density lipoproteins; (4) the study of the allosteric activation sites of the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; (5) the preparation of non-spherically symmetric dendrimers with novel, engineered features such as canyons, clefts, and pockets and (6) the study of the reaction kinetics of larger (more than two carbons) alkyl peroxy radicals with other atmospheric constituents. In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities, including training on the responsible conduct of research, laboratory safety, and scientific communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training. This REU site aims to provide students without significant research experience a chance to conduct cutting-edge research in the chemical sciences with dedicated faculty mentors at this predominantly undergraduate institution. The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for further study in the chemical sciences, graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>
