    <AbstractNarration>This research program is aimed at performing precision co-magnetometry using atomic physics tools to enable sensitive searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. These experiments will employ a dual-species maser operating simultaneously with optically-pumped Xenon-129 and Helium-3 gas. By using one of the noble-gas masers as a co-magnetometer, and stabilizing its maser frequency by comparison to an atomic clock, one can precisely control the magnetic field environment of the second noble-gas maser and then employ this maser as a very sensitive sensor for new physics that couples to the noble gas nucleus, with no significant contribution from the atomic electrons. The experiments to be carried out include a sensitive test of Lorentz symmetry (one of the fundamental aspects of the theory of relativity) and CPT (Charge conjugation, Parity, and Time reversal) symmetry for the neutron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the program include the application of the atomic physics based precision measurement techniques of this research into the development of novel tools for magnetometry and bioimaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at low magnetic fields of hyperpolarized noble gas inhaled into human lungs and atom-like Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond, which may provide sensitive magnetometers to monitor electromagnetic activity in neuronal networks, are two examples.</AbstractNarration>
