    <AbstractNarration>This research project is designing, evaluating, and implementing a interdomain routing system to ensure its scalability while at the same time easing the management load and enhancing the robustness of multi-homed networks. The project develops "multiprocess routing", an approach that runs multiple parallel routing processes that select primary or backup routes to deliver packets with high probability under multiple link and node failures, or misconfigurations. Multiprocess routing is particularly appropriate for multihomed networks where each network has multiple providers and potentially can be reached with node/edge disjoint paths. A hierarchical automatic addressing scheme is being incorporated in the context of multiprocess routing. The hierarchical automatic addressing scheme provides multihomed networks with multiple addresses, each of which are allocated within the address block of its provider. This address allocation scheme can effectively reduce routing table size and routing update messages since providers can aggregate their customers? addresses and announce the whole address block rather than the specific address block for each customer. Furthermore, the automatic addressing protocol used here for host addressing can ease the management of multiple addresses for each network host. This project also establishes a collaboration with networking researchers in Japan.</AbstractNarration>
