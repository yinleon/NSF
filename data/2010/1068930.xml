    <AbstractNarration>Enhancing Research: A Workshop for Political Scientists from Underrepresented Groups &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project organizes a three-day workshop for young political scientists from underrepresented minority groups. The workshop will be held at Duke University in February 2011, and will consist of panels devoted to mentoring, developing networks, publishing, teaching, and the tenure process for faculty members in higher education. A dozen panelists will present to 36 junior faculty participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the numbers of underrepresented minorities with doctorates in political science are increasing slowly, the numbers receiving tenure are not increasing proportionately. This workshop will offer guidance to help participants in their professional development. The workshop will thus help ensure that a diverse group of scholars is conducting political science research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to its intellectual merits, the workshop has significant and substantial broader impacts. It is expressly designed to broaden the participation and retention of underrepresented groups in political science as a profession. The workshop deliberately focuses on enhancing scientific networks and collaboration. It actively engages in the training of young political scientists who are members of underrepresented groups, and is intended to increase the probability that they will be able to contribute to advancing the field and to teaching future generations. The workshop thus enhances the diversity of the discipline of political science, making important contributions to scholarship, teaching, learning, and society at large.</AbstractNarration>
