    <AbstractNarration>This EAGER proposal seeks to develop new, improved approaches, based on single- and multi-objective differential evolution, to the following important problems:&lt;br/&gt;(i) QoS-based multicast routing in mobile networks; (ii) Energy-efficient routing in hierarchical (two-tiered) wireless sensor networks; (iii) Stability-aware clustering in mobile ad hoc networks with special consideration of group mobility; and (iv) Cross-layer optimization in wireless sensor networks by joint routing and link scheduling in the presence of energy constraints, link interference and noise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to achieve higher energy saving, better network performance and extended network lifetimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novelty of this proposal is that it brings the power of differential evolution, a cutting-edge strategy in present-day computational intelligence research, to a group of outstanding, NP-hard problems in computer networks. It presents novel schemes for encoding of trial solutions and also for designing the differential operator for these problems. This research cuts across conventional subject lines ? it embodies an interdisciplinary and transformative application of ideas from electrical engineering, computer communications, computational intelligence, and statistical machine learning. This has the potential to open up a radically new direction in networking research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research is far-reaching in this era of ubiquitous and pervasive computing. The efficiency, flexibility, and controllability provided in the proposed methods can be used to save costs and improve the quality of the final products in the industry. The proposal also includes well-thought out plans for integrating research and education. The PI will use this project to involve high-school students, women, and undergraduate/graduate students in computer science research.</AbstractNarration>
