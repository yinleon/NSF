    <AbstractNarration>Crocodiles are mistakenly referred to as ?living fossils? due to the repeated evolution of similar looking skull and body shapes throughout their history. Thus, they appear not to have changed in millions of years. This repeated evolution of similar features (convergent evolution) confounds scientists? efforts to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of extinct crocodiles. This project will construct a dataset of physical characteristics from myriad fossil forms, including a new fossil from Oregon. New and previously implemented methods will be utilized to test whether characteristics are the result of shared ancestry or similar ecology (e.g. similar diet). This information will be used to determine the relationships within the group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paleontology is among the most publically accessible scientific endeavors and offers a gateway to enhancing overall interest in science. The Oregon fossil will be exhibited in the Condon Collection of Fossils, University of Oregon, incorporating results of this project. Investigators will also present findings of this research to amateur paleontology groups, school groups, and disseminate it to the scientific community through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at scientific meetings. The techniques developed will be applicable for all investigators studying relationships of groups that show convergent evolution. Data produced for this project will be made available for future research through publically accessible formats.</AbstractNarration>
