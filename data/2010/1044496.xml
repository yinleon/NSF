    <AbstractNarration>The DMC Connect project is integrating the NSDL Developmental Mathematics Collection with complementary initiatives in California at the departmental, regional and state levels. This is promoting use of - and contribution to - the Developmental Math Collection within these initiatives. It is also extending the Developmental Math Collection with ongoing addition of resources, and providing a sustainability model for continued evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the departmental level, the project is working with community colleges in the three large urban regions of the state to identify exemplary resources from departmental collections that merit inclusion in the NSDL Developmental Math Collection, and to support faculty in providing the pedagogical content knowledge required for re-use and adaptation beyond the college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DMC Connect project is also expanding regional collaborations with explicit two-way links to the Developmental Math Collection: promoting resources on exemplary teaching practices to the NSDL, and linking NSDL Developmental Math Collection resources to relevant regional cooperative activities to adapt, extend and evaluate the NSDL resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the state level, the DMC Connect project is providing two professional development workshops for Developmental Math faculty in collaboration with the Basic Skills Initiative for the California community colleges, on Mobilizing Resources and Knowledge for Exemplary Teaching in Developmental Math and on Evaluation and Improvement and Knowledge Exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through a national Advisory Panel, the project is building links between the Developmental Mathematics Collection and other major state and national initiatives, with a particular focus on preparing faculty for more transformational change in learning and teaching for developmental mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
