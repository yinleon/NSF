    <AbstractNarration>This workshop is the third in a series of bi-lateral workshops focused on cooperation, collaboration and federation between GENI, a suite of network research infrastructure supported by NSF, and FIRE, a networking researchers' initiative supported by the European Commission. The first workshop was held in Madrid; the second one was held in Seattle. This one will take place in Brussels the 30 September and 1 October at the EU premises. The EC project FIREWorks is facilitating the event. Serge Fdida (EU) and Joe Evans (US) are serving as co-chairs. This proposal will support the travel costs of about 18 US researchers and developers to travel to Brussels to participate in the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the workshop will be on bilateral discussions between FIRE and GENI projects working in the same domains. Different themes are being identified for this bilateral dialogue in order to achieve in-depth technical exchanges and to define possible collaborations. These themes will include, for example, sensors, clouds, service architectures, smart cities, social networking, security, and network infrastructure. Ideally, these bilateral discussions will move collaborative efforts forward by identifying bilateral teams that will plan and develop cross-Atlantic experiments that utilize both GENI and FIRE infrastructure capabilities. The workshop will have impact in a number of ways. By building on complementary strengths, the collaborations envisioned here will enable both communities to accelerate and expand the horizons of networking and future Internet research. The workshop and the collaborations that come out of it provide for specific research and education opportunities in an international context.</AbstractNarration>
