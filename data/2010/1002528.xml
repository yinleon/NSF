    <AbstractNarration>Demographic studies indicate that ethnic and racial minorities, and women continue to be under-represented in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. With support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Western Michigan University and Wayne State University established the Michigan-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (MI-LSAMP) in 2005. This activity was launched to help diversify the workforce to include greater numbers of under-represented minorities (URM) to reflect the population and enable students and faculty to collaborate in diverse groups, a requirement for effective work in the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MI-LSAMP?s continuing goal is to double the number of URM students earning baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields by 2015. As a Mid-Level Alliance, the MI-LSAMP will fully exploit best practices identified during the Phase I effort, and expand collaborations with 9 Michigan community colleges in order to significantly increase the number of enrolled students who have the potential to be successful with support from the MI-LSAMP. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the Phase I effort we learned and confirmed that transfer admissions, Pre-First Year transition programs and research are very effective tools for recruiting, retaining and ensuring the graduation of MI-LSAMP students. We also learned, via surveys and evaluations, that participation in the MI-LSAMP alliance-wide activities, mentoring through the multicultural services offices, and establishment of a local support network contributed to a successful first year. After careful consideration of their commitment to diversity, proximity to the 4-year MI-LSAMP institutions and demographics, Grand Rapids Community College, Kalamazoo Valley Community College, Kellogg Community College, Lake Michigan College, Lansing Community College, Macomb Community College, Muskegon Community College, Washtenaw Community College and Wayne County Community College District were invited to formally collaborate with the MI-LSAMP. These institutions were also selected because of their collaborations with other 4-year institutions in the State or Michigan&lt;br/&gt;that could be used to disseminate findings and extend the reach of the MI-LSAMP. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Michigan-Ann Arbor is the lead institution for this project. The aforementioned programs and activities will be continued and enhanced over the next five years for all participating institutions.</AbstractNarration>
