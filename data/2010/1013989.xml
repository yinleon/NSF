    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of nanolayer transistors composed of a new channel material for high temperature and low noise applications. The new nanolayer transistors are expected to have significantly better performance in an operating temperature range of 300 to 400 degrees C, as well as low noise and high gain relative to currently available transistors. Currently, electronics cannot operate at 300 degree C or higher, temperatures encountered in oil drilling, aerospace, automotive, and other hot noisy environments. This project will use standard semiconductor processing equipment to fabricate a device structure that consists of nanolayers of material grown controllably by atomic layer deposition. Device feasibility will be shown through current modulation with applied gate voltage. Attempts will also be made to investigate transistor I-V characteristics and their temperature dependence on probed devices. A successful device demonstration may be an impetus to additional studies on the effects of an electric field in these ultrathin materials, including better theoretical treatments, materials characterization, novel materials, and impurity trap measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project, if successful, can be large to the economy and society. Availability of high temperature and lower noise electronics can lead to better monitoring and control of environments like oil drilling, jet and automobile engines, and high temperature industrial processes. Devices with better noise performance can reduce cell phone dropouts and extend cell range. The market for electronics for currently unserved sensor opportunities can grow to $100M as volume applications are addressed.</AbstractNarration>
