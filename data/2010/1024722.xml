    <AbstractNarration>As a consequence of advances in information technology and communication unprecedented quantities of information are available for use in making decisions and this information can be transmitted at unprecedented speed. At the same time, the process for integrating these vast quantities of data is daunting and particularly so given that much of the data available is incomplete and unreliable. Three events bringing together scholars in a variety of disciplines (e.g., computer science, economics, decision theory and mathematics) to explore possibilities for developing algorithmic methods for addressing the information aggregation / decision making problem engendered by the availability of vast quantities of noisy data and applied workshops to consider how such algorithms might be applied in specific domains (e.g., health care, ecology and port security) will be conducted. These are:&lt;br/&gt;1) Sessions at the Second International Conference on Algorithmic Decision Theory aimed at identifying concrete research projects/problems involving aggregation of vast quantities of noisy data and and small working group meetings following the conference to spell out those projects.&lt;br/&gt;2) Two workshops, one on Algorithmic Decision Theory for the Smart Grid and one on Algorithmic Decision Theory for Robust Ports.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These activities are intended to spawn new networks among researchers in many fields and provide new methods and tools for addressing many important decision problems that confront policy makers.</AbstractNarration>
