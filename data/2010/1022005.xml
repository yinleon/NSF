    <AbstractNarration>The long-distance migrations of sea turtles involve some of the most extraordinary feats of navigation in the animal kingdom. Newly hatched turtles follow complex migratory pathways that span entire ocean basins. Older turtles regularly travel between feeding areas and nesting sites that can be more than a thousand miles apart. This study uses behavioral experiments to investigate the mystery of how sea turtles guide themselves across vast expanses of seemingly featureless ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Growing evidence indicates that a sea turtle's navigational prowess depends in part on a sophisticated ability to perceive the Earth's magnetic field. Turtles are evidently able to detect the very slight differences in the Earth's magnetic field that exist in different geographic areas. One set of experiments investigates how young turtles use these differences as navigational markers during their first migration. Another set of experiments focuses on how older turtles learn the magnetic topography of the areas where they live and develop 'magnetic maps', which help them to navigate to specific destinations. &lt;br/&gt;An improved understanding of how sea turtles guide themselves during transoceanic migrations will benefit conservation efforts to save these jeopardized species - and other ocean migrants - from extinction. In addition, the results of the work may provide insights into new guidance strategies that can be adapted to human navigation. Finally, the work attracts the interest of many undergraduate and graduate students and thus provides an excellent mechanism for teaching principles of scientific research, as well as giving students direct, hands-on experience with species of special concern.</AbstractNarration>
