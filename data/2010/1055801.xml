    <AbstractNarration>ECCS-1055801&lt;br/&gt;Pamela Bhatti, Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;CAREER An Ultra-Low-Power MEMS-Based Implantable Biosystem for Restoring Vestibular Function-Platform for an Integrated Human-Centered Hybrid Biosystem&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to design, fabricate and validate an ultra-low-power implantable biomedical microsystem. The approach is to: (1) integrate an ultra-low-power biomimetic MEMS-based angular rotation sensor, (2) design and implement low power sensor interface and signal processing electronics, (3) fabricate highly flexible polymeric multichannel electrode arrays for electrical stimulation, and (4) integrate and validate the system in-vitro and eventually in-vivo. This will lead to an ultra-low-power fully implantable biosystem capable of activating vestibular nerve fibers in the inner ear serving to convey head rotation cues to the central nervous system serving to establish a sense of body position, maintain balance, and stabilize vision during movement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Individuals suffering from bilateral vestibular dysfunction experience postural imbalance, dizziness and nausea and currently have no effective therapeutic options. Vestibular and associated balance dysfunction often leads to falls falls are linked to high rates of mortality and morbidity in the elderly, contributing significantly to today?s skyrocketing healthcare costs. By integrating an ultra-low-power passive MEMS-based angular rotation sensor, to aggressively reduce power consumption, and by integrating highly flexible polymeric multichannel electrode arrays, to enable focused current delivery to vestibular nerves, a viable low-power implantable vestibular biosystem may restore vestibular function and improve the quality of life for these individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed sensing mechanism and low-power processing electronics may serve as a platform for an integrated human-centered hybrid biosystem such as a body worn device to measure angular head rotation, essential tremor or gait. To broaden participation of underrepresented groups, the PI integrates her research with outreach, mentoring, and teaching to engage students across the K-graduate continuum including Science Nights at an Atlanta science center, co-developing science modules with middle/high school teachers, developing a LabVIEW simulation of vestibular testing, and a graduate course addressing implantable biosystems.</AbstractNarration>
