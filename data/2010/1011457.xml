    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;This is a new Science Master's degree Program in Quantitative Fisheries and Resource Economics that is designed and managed in consultation with state and federal agencies. The goal of the project is to enhance the preparation and increase the graduation of students in two areas where there is a critical need for experts in the U.S. to manage fisheries resources. This innovative program prepares graduates with the knowledge, quantitative, communication, and leadership skills required for careers in natural resources, with a focus on fisheries management and conservation. Graduates will have completed 37 or 38 credit hours, including a non-thesis project of three credit hours as part of their internship experience. They will also have completed a 3-month internship at a government agency or a consulting firm. The program offers courses online and in the evening and weekend. The curriculum includes courses that enhance students' communication and leadership skills, courses in resource economics, and a curriculum in fisheries science that includes courses essential for training fisheries scientists. These courses will be made available to other graduate students at University of Maryland Eastern Shore and to other institutions. The program is broadening participation in science through the recruitment and training of talented U.S. citizens, including underrepresented minority groups.</AbstractNarration>
