    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to study condensation, surface wetting transitions and ice formation at superhydrophobic surfaces through a synergetic combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. Superhydrophobic surfaces are promising for a wide variety of interesting applications. Up to date, most published research on superhydrophobicity is focused on the effects of surface topology on water contact angle by trapping macroscopic air pockets at geometrically heterogeneous surfaces. While the extraordinary water repellency of a superhydrophobic surface can be successfully described by various modifications of Young?s equations, the macroscopic approach is insufficient to describe surface phase transitions affiliated with broader applications of superhydrophobic surfaces including anti-fogging and/or anti-icing. Such broader applications hinge on a better understanding of the surface hydrophobicity that depends on the microscopic details of the substrate and different states of water at inhomogeneous conditions. By bringing together complementary expertise, the research team will (i) establish a theoretical framework to describe vapor deposition, surface wetting transition and ice nucleation at superhydrophobic surfaces, (ii) develop practical schemes for fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces with systematically tailored surface morphologies and chemical properties, (iii) conduct real-time study of condensation and icing on superhydrophobic surfaces using custom-designed experimental systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research grant will contribute to the fundamental knowledge base of superhydrophobic surfaces in contact with different states of water. The project will provide graduate and undergraduate students, particularly the underrepresented minorities, with opportunities to get first-hand experience on cutting-edge research. The students will particularly benefit from exposure to both theory and experiments. The research team will promote outreach to high school and exposure of underrepresented minority pre-college students to science and innovations through (i) development of high-school course unit and "Sustainability Innovation" hands-on science workshops at Pitt and (ii) the Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement Schools Program at UCR.</AbstractNarration>
