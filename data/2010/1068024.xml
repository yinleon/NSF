    <AbstractNarration>The electrocaloric effect is a physical behavior where the temperature of a material changes due to the application of an electric field. Recently it has been discovered that some ferroelectric materials exhibit a very large electrocaloric response, or "giant" electrocaloric effect. The goal of the proposed research is to develop computational modeling and simulation tools to study the electrocaloric effect in ferroelectric ceramic materials. These tools will then be used to study the thermal, mechanical and electrical fields in ferroelectric materials, and to predict the performance and efficiency of cooling devices made from these materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The societal benefits of the proposed research stem from the fact that virtually all of the world's cooling and refrigeration technology is based upon the vapor-compression cycle of a refrigerant. Refrigeration systems based upon the vapor-compression cycle are generally bulky given that the coolant expands into a gaseous state, require moving parts in the compressor, and in some cases have a less than optimal environmental impact. The relatively recent discovery of the giant electrocaloric effect in ferroelectric ceramics may lead to new solid state cooling technologies that are energy efficient, reliable, portable, and environmentally friendly. Thin film devices that utilize the electrocaloric effect could have a significant impact on refrigeration, heat pumps, air conditioning, energy scavenging, and computer cooling. The computational simulation tools developed in the proposed research program will facilitate the understanding of the fundamental thermo-electrical behavior of ferroelectrics and will aid in the design of solid state cooling devices.</AbstractNarration>
