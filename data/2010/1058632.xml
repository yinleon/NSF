    <AbstractNarration>Summary: This EAGER project is to promote interdisciplinary research and education involving computing as a central component. A community of people who have been successful in such efforts and who have an interest in discussing the best ways to promote and strengthen these is being gathered together to discuss this area of high national interest. The eventual outcome of this effort is to create a home for such discussion and fill the need to have a national venue. The primary goal is to create connections among the stakeholders and help to develop a clear view of impediments they might face and determine what types of support and encouragements the interdisciplinary research and education community might need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project is creating a space for discussions around interdisciplinary research and education. This is very important for the support of the scientific enterprise, both applied and research oriented. Creating a common forum with viable communication channels among diverse fields will provide new opportunities for mutual enrichment and significant intellectual products.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The most significant impact of this will be within the nascent communities of trans disciplinary scholars. Although we know of specific instances of valuable efforts, these communities frequently expend too much of their energy and effort in overcoming impediments rather than in advancing knowledge in their combined fields. The specific results of this project will depend on what the members of the community decide, but possible results could include a new conference series, new publications, and new online communities designed specifically for these needs.</AbstractNarration>
