    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests partial funding support to organize a short course on&lt;br/&gt;Spin Transport and Devices during the 68th Device Research Conference. This short course aims&lt;br/&gt;to introduce the device physics community attending DRC to the new science and potential&lt;br/&gt;applications of spin electronics and optoelectronics. It will bring together world experts in spin&lt;br/&gt;science and technology and it will foster student participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The proposed short course on spin transport and devices will provide student&lt;br/&gt;participants with an opportunity to gain exposure the basic physics and potential engineering&lt;br/&gt;applications of spin devices. The timing of this workshop is perfect for this generation of&lt;br/&gt;students to learn how the new science and technology of spin devices is developing. These&lt;br/&gt;lessons will be useful beyond spin electronics, as these students will be able to apply them to&lt;br/&gt;future new materials and technologies that they will encounter during their career. Special effort&lt;br/&gt;will be made to involve female and minority students in the short course by advertisement and&lt;br/&gt;active recruitment. In addition, the conference proceedings will be available online through the&lt;br/&gt;IEEE IEEExplore which will make them accessible world-wide.</AbstractNarration>
