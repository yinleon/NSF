    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a series of Professional Skills Development workshops aimed at improving the communication and negotiation skills of female physicists. These workshops are modeled on ones initiated by the Committee on the Advancement of Women in Chemistry (COACh), and are a continuation of a previous series of workshops which have sought to address the under representation of women in physics at all levels from undergraduate students to full professors and on into prominent leadership roles in the field. These workshops are important to women scientists as they seek to achieve their full potential, advance in their careers, and reach the top ranks of their profession. The continuing workshops will contain two new aspects: 1) they will include female graduate students who are seeking permanent employment (rather than a postdoctoral fellowship) immediately following their PhD in the professional skills development workshops, and 2) there will be a workshop on advanced leadership for women who are in or advancing toward leadership positions. This award is funded through the Division of Physics and the Division of Materials Research within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
