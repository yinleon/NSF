    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-1011793&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Thomas H. Parker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves analytic aspects of the theory of pseudo-&lt;br/&gt;holomorphic and harmonic maps. The PI's recent work with Junho&lt;br/&gt;Lee has established a remarkable link between Gromov-Witten&lt;br/&gt;theory in dimensions 2 and 4. The first project aims to complete&lt;br/&gt;this program (with Lee) by explicitly calculating the local GW&lt;br/&gt;invariants that determine the GW invariants of a wide class of&lt;br/&gt;Kahler surfaces. The planned technique, a homotopy of operators&lt;br/&gt;together with the symplectic sum formula, should be useful in&lt;br/&gt;other contexts. GW is especially effective in making predictions&lt;br/&gt;about Calabi-Yau 3-folds. The second proposed project seeks to&lt;br/&gt;use geometric analysis methods to prove the Gompakumar-Vafa&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture, which is a fascinating prediction by physicists that&lt;br/&gt;the plethora of GW numbers are determined by a more limited&lt;br/&gt;collection of "BPS numbers". In a third project, the PI and&lt;br/&gt;J. Lee aim to prove that, under certain hypotheses, the space of&lt;br/&gt;stable $J$-holomorphic maps is generically a smooth manifold, a&lt;br/&gt;long-sought result. Finally, Project 4 is a study of the&lt;br/&gt;finite-time singularities of the harmonic map heat flow. The&lt;br/&gt;idea is to use analysis on path space to show that the maps&lt;br/&gt;develop "necks" whose images converge to geodesics in a precise&lt;br/&gt;manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most notable developments in recent mathematics has&lt;br/&gt;been the remarkable confluence of ideas coming from string&lt;br/&gt;theory, algebraic geometry, and symplectic geometry. A major&lt;br/&gt;part of the story revolves around the idea of counting&lt;br/&gt;holomorphic curves in algebraic manifolds (this is a geometric&lt;br/&gt;formulation of one of the most fundamental programs in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics: classifying the solutions of systems of polynomial&lt;br/&gt;equations). The counting problem was studied for 100 years with&lt;br/&gt;few results. Then, around 1990, it was realized that the problem&lt;br/&gt;can be translated into symplectic geometry and tackled using the&lt;br/&gt;machinery of mathematical Gauge Theory, a theory that arose from&lt;br/&gt;interactions between mathematics and physics. This&lt;br/&gt;"Gromov-Witten invariant" approach quickly led to formulas&lt;br/&gt;answering some of the original curve-counting problems. This&lt;br/&gt;project is aimed at further developing Gromov-Witten theory using&lt;br/&gt;the methods of geometric analysis, and applying similar&lt;br/&gt;techniques to related problems in the theory of harmonic maps.</AbstractNarration>
