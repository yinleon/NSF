    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop an inorganic-reinforced proton exchange membranes for application in vanadium redox flow batteries (RFBs). New proton exchange membranes with reduced vanadium permeability as well as enhanced stability and durability are needed for cost-effective operation of RFBs. The composite membrane to be developed will have high chemical stability in RFB electrolytes, high proton conductivity, and low permeability of vanadium ions, along with high dimensional stability, high mechanical strength, and high durability. The project will establish composition-processing-property relations of the novel composite membrane through detailed characterization. The performance of the membrane for vanadium RFBs will also be evaluated. Issues related to scale up of the membrane production will be identified and addressed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project, if successful, will advance the development of RFB technology for stationary electrical energy storage. The feature of decoupling between the energy and power, and the extremely large capacities possible from RFBs make them well suited to use in large power storage and high output applications such as for transmission grid operations, in helping to average out the production of highly variable generation sources such as wind or solar power. RFBs'rapid response times also make them well suited to uninterrupted power supply (UPS) type applications.</AbstractNarration>
