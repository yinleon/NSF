    <AbstractNarration>The Iowa Community College Information Assurance and Computer Security Training (ICCIACST - pronounced I see, I act) program is a two-year program for information technology (IT) instructors from community colleges in Iowa and adjacent states to gain or expand their information assurance and computer security knowledge. The program provides curricular materials needed to implement a security course and incorporate real world exercises into class work. IT instructors participate in year-long distance education courses with a one week, on-site, intensive summer workshop as a capstone event. At the end of the second summer session, in addition to incorporating security across IT curriculum, the IT instructors are able to run their own security outreach programs including a cyber defense competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Community colleges across the nation serve a high percentage of populations underrepresented in the science and technology areas, including minorities and women. By focusing on improving the information assurance and computer security knowledge and skill of the IT instructors at community colleges, students in underrepresented populations are given access to more complete information and can broaden their own understanding of security principles. Further, many students in an information technology (IT) track at a community college enter the job market as an IT professional. They need knowledge, experience and understanding of the importance of security when implementing IT projects since many of them are becoming the IT staff who are ?in the trenches? connecting computers, servers, networks, as well as writing code, to support the most basic needs in the IT industry.</AbstractNarration>
