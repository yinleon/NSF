    <AbstractNarration>This award continues an REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) Site program in Biogeochemistry and Climate at the University of California, Irvine's Department of Earth System Science. The principal goal of the program is to inspire and encourage qualified undergraduate students to seek graduate training in the Earth Sciences and to contribute to the generation of new knowledge and solutions for societal problems related to climate change. Over a period of nine weeks, eight students will be exposed to a broad range of scientific issues relating to global climate change and to a diverse, interdisciplinary research environment. Activities include individual and supervised research, group readings and discussions, cohort-building, exposure to the national scientific community, professional skill development and guidance concerning graduate education in climate science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the summer program, students will work independently, in teams, and with their mentors to further understanding of physical and biogeochemical processes that influence the Earth's climate system on time scales relevant to a human lifetime. The research fields are diverse, including atmospheric, oceanic, terrestrial, and polar systems. The research projects cover a range of disciplines, including atmospheric chemistry, marine and terrestrial biogeochemistry, air/sea gas exchange, ocean circulation, sea ice and ice-sheet dynamics, and paleoclimatology. During the course of their project, the students will gain hands-on experience with geochemical analysis, remote sensing, data analysis, and/or numerical simulation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The organizers seek to recruit from a wide range of institutions to expand the number and diversity of students seeking careers in the fields of Biogeochemistry and Climate by providing a unique educational experience to qualified students from undergraduate institutions. It especially targets students from institutions that do not have active research programs (or have only limited programs) in this field, and to students who are members of historically underrepresented groups in the Earth Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
