    <AbstractNarration>Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana (SUBR) will initiate a project entitled Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering Education in Energy Materials (RISE3M) as a 3-year Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Research Infrastructure in Science and Engineering (HBCU-RISE) award. The PIs propose to continue and expand expertise in materials science research developed as part of a previous HBCU-RISE project (HRD-0734845) to encompass the area of sustainable energy production through the use of modern energy materials. The synergism of these two areas includes the shared knowledge in the development of efficient and alternative energy materials for power production as well as access to complimentary materials characterization approaches among researches involved in this project. The work also complements an existing CREST Center for Next Generation Composite Materials (HRD-0932300). The research and education activities will foster the development of new knowledge, processes, and products in material science and engineering applicable to advanced materials for sustainable energy generation and utilization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is organized around several thrusts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental knowledge&lt;br/&gt;*Correlate microstructure with physical properties of photoelectron-chemical materials for the photoelectrolysis of water; &lt;br/&gt;*Fabrication and analysis of an actuating polymer technology;&lt;br/&gt;*Development and fabrication of functionally graded ceramic thermal barrier coatings; &lt;br/&gt;*Characterization of thermo-mechanical properties of novel energy materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technology applications&lt;br/&gt;*Photoelectrical chemical power generation; &lt;br/&gt;*Design and improvement of polymers for photovoltaic solar power generation; &lt;br/&gt;*New thermal barrier coating to reduce the repair time and cost in gas turbine power generation industry; &lt;br/&gt;*Improvements in gas turbine power output and efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Education and outreach&lt;br/&gt;*Advanced material characterization and composite materials and structures courses; &lt;br/&gt;*Increased number of minority students in undergraduate &amp; graduate research; &lt;br/&gt;*Enhanced research infrastructure for Ph.D. in Materials Science &amp; Engineering; &lt;br/&gt;*Provide an nformation resource for potential collaborators and dissemination; &lt;br/&gt;*Involvement of K-12 through graduate level in the integration of STEM research &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will lead to the development of new knowledge, processes, and products in materials science and engineering, for application in sustainable energy generation and utilization. . The synergism of these thrust areas includes the shared knowledge in the development of efficient and alternative energy materials for power production as well as access to complimentary materials characterization approaches among researches involved in this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The research will contribute to the development of sustainable technologies that will decrease the dependence of the US on fossil fuels. Therefore, broader impacts extend to the improvement of the environment and the economic benefit of society. Consistent with the goals of the RISE proposals, this award will strengthen the doctoral student research capacity in a new area of materials science research at Southern, which currently has the largest number of African American graduate students in science and engineering. The present award will play a significant role in the university?s efforts to achieve doctoral level II status, a rarity among HBCU institutions. The project includes a specific human resource development plan for graduate student development, post doctoral associate training,, integration of education and research, and outreach to the general public, particularly in the southern regions of the US.</AbstractNarration>
