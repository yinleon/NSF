    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funding to improve the existing flow-through seawater system at the Coastal and Marine Institute Laboratory (CMIL) of San Diego State University. The current laboratory houses marine science faculty and is a shared use facility with the U.S. Geological Survey. The proximity of CMIL to San Diego Bay, situated in an urban environment, provides opportunities for both basic and applied research. The existing seawater system has chronic problems with total suspended solids and episodic problems with lower salinity. The requested enhancements to the seawater system will provide consistent, high- quality seawater. The availability of quality seawater is vital to sustain and continue growth of research and educational activities at CMIL, providing faculty and students at SDSU and at other institutions ample opportunities and experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was good integration of education at many levels from middle school through high school by way of specific high school training programs. CMIL hosts a variety of educational programs including research training of undergraduates, public open houses, middle- and high school research-training programs focusing on underrepresented minorities, teacher training workshops, etc. SDSU has excellent track record with minority education in general (top 10 of awarding degrees to Hispanics). Approximately thirty graduate students and undergraduates use the CMIL for research projects.</AbstractNarration>
