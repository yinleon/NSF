    <AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;Complex oxide materials offer myriad opportunities to discover and learn about novel fundamental magnetic and electronic phenomena and phases relevant to both fundamental science and technology. This award supports a project that will address some of the most timely and intellectually challenging scientific issues in this field by pursuing advanced crystal growth and neutron scattering studies of a number materials that are likely to hold the key to resolving such timely questions as: the role of disorder in model quantum magnets; why the temperature where a material becomes a superconductor is very high in some materials, but not in others; the roles of coexisting and competing phases and of magnetic excitations. A comprehensive approach will be pursued through collaborations with experts using complementary experimental tools. This effort covers the full range from crystal growth, to materials characterization, to neutron scattering, to extensive collaborations. Consequently, this materials-based research program will provide rich educational opportunities in materials physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;This individual investigator award supports a project that will investigate some of the most timely topics in the field of correlated-electron materials by pursuing crystal growth and neutron scattering studies of a number of complex oxides that are likely to hold the key to resolving such timely questions as: the role of disorder in model quantum magnets; the fundamental differences between electron and hole doping of the high transition-temperature (Tc) cuprate superconductors; why Tc is very high in some cuprates, but not in others; the roles of coexisting and competing phases and of magnetic excitations.
