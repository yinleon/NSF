    <AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry supports David Rogow of the University of California - Berkeley as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. Rogow will work with Prof. Jeffrey Long to synthesize a series of metal-organic framework (MOF) materials using high-throughput synthesis methods. In particular, the research will focus on developing materials which can efficiently and selectively adsorb carbon dioxide. In addition, materials will be incorporated into polymer membranes for development of MOF/polymer composite membranes for gas processing applications. Additional work will be carried out in collaboration with scientists at the Advanced Light Source of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, to conduct in-situ, x-ray diffraction studies of these materials, in order to explore the details of the ways in which carbon dioxide is incorporated into these materials. For his plan for broadening participation, the PI will work with at-risk youth in an area Job Corps Program (Treasure Island Job Corps) as well as other Job Corps programs on the West Coast (San Jose, Wolf Creek, Tongue Point, and others).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that of Dr. Rogow is aimed at developing better materials for carbon dioxide removal from gas streams. Results from research like that supported here will lead to better methods for carbon dioxide separation and removal, which can significantly impact efforts at reducing the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Rogow are aimed at encouraging young people, especially those from groups underrepresented in the sciences, to consider pursuing higher education in science and technology areas.</AbstractNarration>
