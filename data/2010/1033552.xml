    <AbstractNarration>1033552&lt;br/&gt;Bennett&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The production of biofuels from renewable resources is currently an area national interest. In particular, butanol isomers have gained interest as an alternative fuel due to their superior fuel properties to relative to ethanol. The proposed research will use metabolic engineering approaches to enable the fermentation of the non-digestible, soluble carbohydrate fraction isolated from many common oilseeds such as soybean, cottonseed, and sunflower seed, to butanol. Many of these materials are byproducts of biodiesel or bioethanol production. For example, large amounts of galactose-rich soluble carbohydrates, constituting approximately 10% of oil seed weight, represent a sustainable yet underutilized feedstock for biofuel. Towards this end, the hydrolysis of the galactose-rich oligosaccharides and subsequent fermentation to 2-butanol by engineered E. coli will be studied and optimized. Furthermore, natural and engineered strains of Clostridia may also be able make effective use of this feedstock. Genetic modules for engineered strains of Clostridia will be developed that enable the efficient uptake and metabolism of galactose-rich oligosaccharides and their fermentation to 1-butanol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education plan will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students in biochemical engineering, molecular biology, and biochemistry. Undergraduate students from under-represented groups will be recruited for these activities through existing programs at Rice University. As part of the outreach plan, after school and summer research experiences for local high school students will be coordinated through the Harmony Science Academy, a largely minority charter school. Some of these students will present their work at the Science &amp; Engineering Fair of Houston and at the International Sustainable World Project Olympiad (Energy, Engineering, &amp; Environment I-SWEEP).</AbstractNarration>
