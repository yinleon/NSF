    <AbstractNarration>This proposal applies for NSF support for the 43rd International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO-43). The MICRO Symposium is a top-tier conference on microprocessor related research and has enjoyed a rich history of success. The research results presented at MICRO conferences have shown strong impacts in this research field and are highly regarded in the computer architecture community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By providing this support to students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty members, the PI expect to extend the range of attendance. We also anticipate that the research results presented at the conference, as well as the emphasis on interaction between academic researchers and industrial designers, will be carried back by attendees to their home institutions resulting in heightened awareness and interests in advanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested funds will be used solely to provide travel support for students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty members in order to defray the costs of attending and participating in MICRO-43. Priority will be given to those students who will present their research at MICRO-43 or its joint workshops. To broaden the participation, the PI will strongly encourage women and members of other under-represented minority groups to apply for the&lt;br/&gt;travel grant.</AbstractNarration>
