    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This multidisciplinary symposium aims to bring together researchers working on quantifying nanoscale carrier transport processes in excitonic solar cells. Excitonic solar cells, including all-organic and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), offer strong potential for inexpensive and large-area solar energy conversion. Unlike traditional inorganic semiconductor solar cells, where all the charge generation and collection processes are well understood, these excitonic solar cells contain extremely disordered structures with complex interfaces which results in large variations in nanoscale electronic properties and has a strong influence on carrier generation, transport, dissociation and collection. Rapid progress in this multidisciplinary area requires strong synergetic efforts among researchers from diverse backgrounds. Such effort can lead to novel methods for development of new materials with improved photon harvesting and interfacial treatments for improved carrier transport, process optimization to yield ordered nanoscale morphologies with well-defined electronic structures. The symposium plans to support the participation of underrepresented groups, including Hispanics, Native Americans, and women, through appropriate travel and registration support. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Efficient and low-cost conversion of solar energy is important for environment protection and energy security of the nation. Excitonic solar cells offer strong potential for inexpensive and large-area solar energy conversion. These excitonic solar cells possess complex internal structure, which results in poor energy conversion efficiency. Rapid progress in this multidisciplinary area requires strong synergetic efforts among researchers from diverse backgrounds. This symposium aims to bring together scientists working on materials science, nanoscience, chemistry and theory to develop synergistic efforts to improve the efficiency of excitonic solar cells.</AbstractNarration>
