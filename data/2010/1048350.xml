    <AbstractNarration>This is a 3-year modeling and data analysis study aimed at understanding an unusual electron density behavior associated with ion temperature spikes that have been observed in the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) data over the summer 2007-2008. The spikes were only found in summer and when both the solar and magnetic activities were very low. The spikes are associated with strong westward convection velocities and steep electron density depletions that are most likely the signature of a high latitude ionization trough. The detection of this phenomenon was facilitated by the continuous running of PFISR and also because of the special conditions provided by the exceptionally low magnetic activity in the solar minimum of 2007-2008. The PFISR data offers a unique perspective on the generation and evolution of the high latitude ionization trough. First, a thorough search and analysis of the PFISR data will be performed to identify as many examples of the trough events as possible from 2007 onward. Secondly, the field line inter-hemispheric plasma (FLIP) model, developed by the PI and used successfully in several previous studies to reproduce PFISR observations, will be employed to simulate the PFISR electron density observations. The ultimate goal is to gain a greater understanding of the chemical and dynamical processes that create and maintain the high latitude ionization trough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are valuable broader impacts resulting from the project as well. Notably, a graduate student would be trained as part of the project. Further, the FLIP model, which is used by many other researchers, would be improved, thereby enhancing its value to the research community.</AbstractNarration>
