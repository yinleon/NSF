    <AbstractNarration>Humor that denigrates women tends to trivialize gender-based discrimination under the veil of benign amusement. Existing research shows that exposure to gender-biased humor can have harmful effects by affecting how men perceive discrimination against women as well as men's actual willingness to discriminate against women. Although framed as "just a joke," this kind of humor can act as a "releaser" of prejudice against women. Gender-biased humor allows men who hold antagonistic attitudes toward women to express their sexism by replacing the usual non-sexist norms in a situation with a norm of tolerance for gender-based discrimination, thereby essentially justifying a wider range of discriminatory actions against women. Across six studies, researchers Thomas E. Ford of Western Carolina University and Julie A. Woodzicka of Washington and Lee University are collaborating in research designed to build upon existing findings in this area. Their research will further advance basic knowledge regarding how gender-biased humor contributes to imbalanced relations between men and women in new and important ways. Ultimately, this research will address issues of critical social relevance by identifying important negative consequences of gender-biased humor for both women and men and by illuminating the role that such humor can play in social interaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative project meets the criterion of an RUI project. It will advance discovery and understanding while promoting the research and educational communities at two primarily undergraduate universities. It will allow the PIs to mentor undergraduate students and Master's level students in the conduct of research. The project will give special consideration to first-generation students who have historically underparticipated in undergraduate research.</AbstractNarration>
