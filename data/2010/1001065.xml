    <AbstractNarration>1001065&lt;br/&gt;Kumpathy&lt;br/&gt;Milwaukee School of Engineering &lt;br/&gt;IRES: Collaborative Research in Materials and Biomedical Applications of Rapid Prototyping with the Non-Ferrous Materials Technology Development Center (NFTDC), Hyderabad, India.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) Professor Subha Kumpathy will launch a three-year International Research Experience for Students (IRES) program with Dr. K. Balasubramanian, Director of India?s premier national center, the Non-Ferrous Materials Technology Development Center (NFTDC) in Hyderabad, India. Each year, 4 undergraduate science and engineering students from the Milwaukee area will conduct six weeks of inter-disciplinary research in materials and biomedical applications of rapid prototyping with lead-mentor Balasubramanian and other researchers at NFTDC's state-of-the-art facilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core research focuses on rapid prototyping for biomedical applications and links materials science with cutting-edge bioengineering for practical applications. The foreign research team and host site have strong core research programs and first-rate facilities to support the proposed work. Students will be engaged in engineering research, rapid prototyping techniques, advances in materials, processing and characterization, biomedical devices and development, interdisciplinary group sessions and seminars, PowerPoint presentations and research posters, all of which is expected to culminate in publishable research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The international component is coupled with integrated pre- and post-activities at the MSOE home campus. Upon return from India, IRES participants will interact with faculty and students to share their research and cultural experiences on-campus. The project is expected to enhance long-term collaborations with Indian colleagues in biomedical and other cutting-edge applications of rapid prototyping. Additionally, offering undergraduates the chance to explore innovative and creative approaches to biomedical applications will serve as an impetus to their continued involvement in research after IRES as well as provide opportunities for global research that they otherwise would not have considered.</AbstractNarration>
