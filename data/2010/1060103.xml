    <AbstractNarration>1060103 &lt;br/&gt;Dellinger &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funds for graduate-student travel stipends to the 12th International Congress on Combustion By-Products and Their Health Effects. The conference will be held in June, 2011, in China at the Jhejiang University in Hangzhou. This is the 12th conference, and approximately 150 researchers are expected to participate. The NSF Combustion and Plasma Systems program has provided support for four previous gatherings of this conference. Travel expenses will be provided for five to ten students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research, and especially environmental research, is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. This meeting is especially designed to bring together engineers, scientists, and health effects researchers to discuss the environmental issues surrounding combustion. Our next generation of researchers must be familiar with these interdisciplinary issues to be successful. By encouraging the participation of students with partial travel support, we are developing and training the next generation of researchers.</AbstractNarration>
