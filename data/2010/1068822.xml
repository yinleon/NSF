    <AbstractNarration>A major workshop, "New developments in non-commutative algebra and its applications", will be held in Scotland, at the Gaelic College on the isle of Skye, in June 2011. Interaction with other areas of mathematics has been a central theme of current non-commutative algebra. Connections to algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, and representation theory are three major overall topics of focus for this workshop and the world-class experts who will speak on them at the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general topic of the conference, noncommutative algebra, involves the study of operations which give different results when performed in a different order. A famous example of this in physics involves the position and momentum operators in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. An important subject in current physics closely connected with the topic is string theory, especially the study of mirror symmetry. Current trends in noncommutative algebra are highly interdisciplinary and touch many other fundamental areas of mathematics. A major workshop such as this brings together many researchers from the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere, and can be crucial to establishing new collaborations and more interactions between mathematicians studying different threads of the subject. This NSF conference grant will allow a larger number of U.S. participants, especially younger mathematicians, to attend by supporting their travel.</AbstractNarration>
