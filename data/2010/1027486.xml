    <AbstractNarration>This Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for Service (SFS) project at California State University Sacramento (CSUS) is providing scholarships to eleven undergraduate and four graduate students enrolled computer science or computer engineering degree programs. The undergraduate students receive their scholarships during the final two years of their degree program and are also earning an undergraduate certificate in information assurance and security. The graduate students receive their scholarships during the two years of their masters program and are also earning a graduate certificate in information assurance and security. The project includes an explicit effort to recruit students from underrepresented groups into the program and has academic support programs to foster their success. The project also includes activities to build community among the students receiving scholarships. CSUS received the National Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security (NSA/DHS) Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE) designation in 2007. The project includes an assessment and evaluation plan coordinated by an independent evaluator to ensure that the project achieves its objectives. The project's results are being disseminated through conference and professional presentations.</AbstractNarration>
