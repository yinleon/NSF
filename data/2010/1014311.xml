    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop a more durable high-temperature solid oxide electrochemical cell that can be used to electrolyze carbon dioxide and water into hydrogen and carbon monoxide for the further production of liquid fuels. The research will be focused on the analyses of the degradation mechanisms and stability of high temperature electrodes. The technology can be used to sequestrate carbon dioxide, convert cheap electricity into chemical energy for storage, and provide a flexible device for the conversion between electricity and chemical energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the project will be that the technology to be developed can be used to sequester carbon dioxide from power plants and meanwhile convert carbon dioxide and water into carbon monoxide and hydrogen for the production of hydrocarbon fuel. The technology will also provide a method to store chemical energy using cheap electricity. The solid oxide electrochemical cell has the potential to be a flexible device operated as either an electrolyzer or fuel cell for the conversion between electricity and chemical fuels. Compared to existing low-temperature water electrolysis, the high-temperature solid oxide electrochemical cell can achieve high energy conversion efficiency.</AbstractNarration>
