    <AbstractNarration>This project by investigators from the University of Washington, and in collaboration with various colleagues, will continue to examine whether the organic molecules or classes of organic compounds found in the organic matrix of diatom frustules are useful biomarkers for the oceanographic conditions under which the organisms grew in the surface ocean. These biomarkers are useful as diatoms are responsible for a substantial fraction of global primary productivity and are globally distributed, ensuring their widespread applicability. Frustules are composed primarily of silica, but there are organic compounds entrapped in the siliceous matrix during biomineralization. This organic template is mostly unexploited in paleoceanographic and related studies, but recent work has suggested that these compounds are potential useful biomarkers. Additionally, it is possible that the isotopic signature of carbon and nitrogen in the organic molecules may provide additional information and insight into ocean conditions during growth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, this project will investigate the organic compound composition and employ molecular isotope analyses of organic compounds in diatom frustules to fully capture the potential of diatom frustules as recorders of the changes in ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles and climate. The project will involve mainly controlled laboratory culture studies, but will also examine field populations and surface sediment samples, to examine the factors that influence the organic template of frustules, and specifically the molecular and isotopic composition of mycosporine-like amino acids, long chain polyamines and chitin extracted from these frustules. The project will also examine whether species composition influences the isotopic signature. The results could provide suitable biomarkers reflective of different important oceanographic conditions, such as past nutrient utilization, and environmental stress (UV and nutrient). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide new methods to examine ocean-climate feedbacks that will help clarify the response of oceans to major regime shifts. The project will support a post-doctoral investigator and a graduate student, and will involve continued international collaboration with Russia scientists. The investigators will also interact and be involved with the University of Washington's Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (COSEE) and work on outreach activities for K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>
