    <AbstractNarration>Animal communication often involves conspicuous and complex signals that are favored by selection because they are preferred by potential mates, but are also exploited by eavesdropping competitor males and predators within a communication network. The evolution of signals is also influenced by the physical environment in which communication takes place. In this study, researchers will investigate how aspects of male signals maximize reception and response of targeted female receivers, and/or reduce exploitation by eavesdroppers. Lab experiments and field studies will address two questions: 1) How does the physical environment of forest floor leaf litter (light spectrum, vegetation background) affect detection and discrimination of male signals by intended receivers (female wolf spiders) and eavesdroppers (male wolf spiders, predatory toads and jumping spiders)? The research uses digital video/audio playback technology to alter male signals and environmental backgrounds (color, visual complexity), to test how aspects of visual signals (motion, background contrast) and/or use of multimodal signals (visual and vibration signals) affect detection and discrimination. 2) How does the social context (male density, prior experience) influence responses to signals by females and male eavesdroppers? Experiments will modify the social environment (male density, encounter experience, mate options available), information content of signals (apparent male quality), and sensory cues (visual, vibration) to determine their influence on females and male eavesdroppers. Taken together, results will allow a better understanding of the function and evolution of animal communication in complex environments. This project will promote teaching, training and learning through collaboration between a research university and a small liberal arts college (Alma College) and a partnership with the Cincinnati Nature Center in multiple ways: involvement of graduate and undergraduate students from both institutions (including under-represented ethnic groups and women) in a research student exchange program, "capstone experience" and "spring term" courses, and public lectures and workshops.</AbstractNarration>
