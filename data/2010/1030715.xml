    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to develop and study the characteristics of novel nanocomposite materials for chemical sensing. The materials involve integrating metal or semi-conductor in polymers. Such materials have exhibited unique electrical conductivity properties important for development of highly selective and sensitive gas sensors. The sensor material will be synthesized using specially-designed a chemical vapor deposition technique that permits optimization of the metal/semiconductor-to-polymer composition ratio. The synthesized material structure will be characterized including chemical composition and morphology, and a model of nanocomposite growth is developed. The sensor performance will be studied by measuring induced electrical conductivity upon exposure to specific gaseous ambience. The experimental results will be used to develop and validate a comprehensive theory of sensor behavior and sensor selectivity, sensitivity and time response to a variety of gaseous surroundings including carbon dioxide and hydrogen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the result of this research will lead to a novel method for intelligent nanomanufacturing and optimization of materials sensing properties. A primary objective of this research is to establish the structure-property relationship ? the link between the key materials parameters (chemical composition, and microstructure) and the resulting sensing responses. The integration of synthesis, characterization, and modeling is the critical component of the proposal which will allow optimization of synthesis conditions in order to obtain materials with the desired sensing properties. The proposed work will also provide a methodology for producing chemical biosensors with selectivity towards ambient conditions that are unique to certain diseases. An example is a sensor for detection of superoxide anion radicals (oxgygen ions) that have been implicated in a number of diseases including cancer and heart disease. Such a sensor could potentially provide a means for early detection and treatment of such diseases.</AbstractNarration>
