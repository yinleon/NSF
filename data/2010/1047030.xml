    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to demonstrate the integration of hybrid materials (both organic and inorganic) onto a flexible substrate using a photolithographic process made possible by the proprietary fluorinated resist chemistry of Orthogonal. First, the challenges of performing photolithography on flexible substrates will be addressed by using new resist materials, and investigating both a lamination process that would place the flexible materials onto a rigid substrate and a roll-to-roll process. At the same time, device parameters will be explored on rigid substrates in order to design and optimize high-performance circuits based on hybrid electronic structures. Finally, the optimized devices will be made on flexible substrates using the best methodology determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to enable the large-scale manufacturing of organic flexible electronic devices by leveraging the existing infrastructure used in the display industry. The complementary circuits based on oxide as well as organic semiconductors will allow for high-performance and low-power circuit designs on plastic for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and sensor applications.</AbstractNarration>
