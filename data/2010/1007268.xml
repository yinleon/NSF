    <AbstractNarration>The 13th Biennial Cellular and Molecular Soybean Meeting will be held on August 8-11, 2010 in Durham (NC). This meeting provides a venue for presenting the most recent advances in soybean genomics and traditionally attracts a diverse group of soybean molecular biologists, breeders, physiologists and pathologists. As such, the meeting provides an excellent opportunity for students and young investigators to meet and interact with scientists in the field, to discuss their research ideas as talks or posters, and to begin to establish the scientific networks that will prove invaluable throughout their careers. The funding provided by NSF will broaden participation by defraying the costs of participation for women and those from underrepresented groups in the U.S. scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
