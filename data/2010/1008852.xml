    <AbstractNarration>Wang&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1008852&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The principal investigator and colleagues study the issue of&lt;br/&gt;quantifying the long-time statistical properties of a few&lt;br/&gt;prototype fluid systems via long-time statistical properties of&lt;br/&gt;suitable discrete dynamical systems related to temporal and/or&lt;br/&gt;spatial approximations. The physical problems considered are the&lt;br/&gt;Rayleigh-Benard convection at large Prandtl number and/or small&lt;br/&gt;Ekman number regime, and a few related simplified models. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, the methodology developed is applied to numerically&lt;br/&gt;quantify an important physical long-time statistical quantity,&lt;br/&gt;the averaged heat transport, in a few convection models. The key&lt;br/&gt;issue here is the design, analysis and implementation of schemes&lt;br/&gt;that are efficient and convergent (in the sense that the&lt;br/&gt;stationary statistical properties of the discrete system converge&lt;br/&gt;to those of the underlying system). Approximating long-time&lt;br/&gt;behavior of large complex systems is a well-known challenge&lt;br/&gt;because small errors could accumulate and amplify. Additional&lt;br/&gt;difficulties related to multiple scales (induced by large Prandtl&lt;br/&gt;number, small Ekman number, large Rayleigh number), and&lt;br/&gt;generalised dynamical system (such as the 3D Boussinesq system)&lt;br/&gt;are also addressed. Suitable random perturbations of the fluid&lt;br/&gt;systems are considered in order to ensure convergence to the&lt;br/&gt;physically relevant long-time behaviour. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Quantifying long-time statistical properties is of great&lt;br/&gt;importance in applications. Besides well-known applications in&lt;br/&gt;classical turbulence theory, it is also extremely important in&lt;br/&gt;climate studies because the predicted climate is the long-time&lt;br/&gt;statistical behaviour of the underlying climate model. The&lt;br/&gt;models to be investigated, although far from practical climate&lt;br/&gt;models, share several important mechanisms that are crucial to&lt;br/&gt;realistic climate models, such as energy-preserving nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;advection, rotation, convection, dissipation/damping and forcing. &lt;br/&gt;A clearer understanding of long-time statistical behavior in this&lt;br/&gt;setting helps us better understand many geophysical fluid&lt;br/&gt;phenomena, and provides guidelines for accurate numerical study&lt;br/&gt;of climate changes. The project also provides abundant&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for graduate students, including student from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented group, to participate in the modeling, analysis,&lt;br/&gt;and computation of many physically motivated problems.</AbstractNarration>
