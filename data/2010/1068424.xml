    <AbstractNarration>OISE 10-68424&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together faculty of the University of Central Florida (UCF) and Vilnius University in Lithuania for collaborative research planning purposes. The research focus is on biological anthropology, specifically auxology and forensic anthropology. The US principal investigator is Leslie Lieberman. The Lithuanian counterpart is Jannina Tutkuviene.&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will allow UCF and VU faculty to exchange information about current their research activities, identify emerging areas for potential collaboration and develop preliminary research proposals. UCF faculty will also become acquainted with the VU collections (8,726 craniological units and 4,962 postcranial osteological units), laboratories, equipment, clinics, databases and other resources. Two possible unique research foci are 1) tracking the lifestyle changes since Lithuania?s independence as reflected by child growth and development parameters and 2) application of technologies to the analyses of the unique skeletal collection held at VU and testing hypotheses with this extensive collection and those in the US and elsewhere. &lt;br/&gt;Longitudinal studies conducted in Lithuania since the 19th century provide a rich data base and baseline for analyses, especially on changes in growth and body composition with rapidly increasing globalized diets and lifestyles. Unlike most of Europe, Lithuanian children have not started to exhibit increases in weight and obesity; and in fact, have shown a trend in the opposite direction.&lt;br/&gt;This activity is expected to facilitate the creation of new knowledge and the expansion of anthropology professional networks and training opportunities for faculty and graduate students in biological anthropology ? specifically in auxology and forensic anthropology with innovative applications to public health, clinical medicine and law enforcement.</AbstractNarration>
