    <AbstractNarration>1032388&lt;br/&gt;Asa-Awuku&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to develop a novel and transformative measurement and modeling technique to investigate the ability of organic components to take up water in the atmosphere. The results of the project will have significant implications in air quality, climate, and health. As such, the results will be incorporated into a long-term research plan relevant to the priorities of the NSF CBET program. The success of this project will result in unique cross-cutting research and educational opportunities to broaden the participation of all citizens in engineering related research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The interactions of organic components and water are not well understood. Hence the uptake of water on organic surfaces has yet to be fully characterized. As a result, non-idealities are often parameterized, but models using this approach fail to reproduce observations in the laboratory and in the field. The PI proposes to explore the physicochemical properties of organic components and directly compare them with high-resolution particle mass spectral fragments. Graduate and undergraduate engineering students will study the thermodynamic and interfacial phenomena of non-ideal organic mixtures. Students will measure volatility, surfactant, and solubility properties. These measurements will be used to understand and develop a new organic hygroscopicity model. In future work, the model and experimental methodologies will be applied to atmospheric aerosol studies. The PI and her students will conduct this research in a state-of-the-art air pollution laboratory at the UC Riverside Bourns College of Engineering- Center for Environmental Research and Technology (CE-CERT). This facility will provide opportunities for the research team to interact with worldwide air pollution research community - scientists and engineers from academic institutions, government agencies, and industry. As the results are developed, these interactions provide a mechanism for disseminating the research for faster incorporation into air quality and climate modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;As an African-American female engineer at one of America's few research-intensive Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI), the PI will act as a role model and mentor to a diverse group of students. Because air quality and the environmental implications of public health are important public issues in the Riverside area, east of Los Angeles, UCR's experience has been that research in this field attracts young people from traditionally underrepresented communities. The PI will show prospective students how they can have an impact on the quality of life in their communities and globally. She will encourage students to become independent investigators with supervisory, situational and informal mentoring techniques. The PI will guide graduate students to conduct innovative research and disseminate findings at regional and national conferences. Undergraduate summer research opportunities will be available in her laboratory; graduate students will have the opportunity to supervise undergraduates. The PI will supervise and develop engineering undergraduate researchers for today's workforce. The PI will also continue her research-mentoring relationships with local high school students and underrepresented students in her field. Lastly, through local seminars and involvement in community programs and regional science fairs, the PI hopes to inspire K-12 students to pursue careers in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
