    <AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;The objective is to develop all-optical switching that will fundamentally transform optical communications for sustainability and scalability, with ambitious goals of very low switching energy, loss, and suitable for chip-scale integration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit includes the invention of a new platform to revolutionize chip-scale integrated optics, and, in particular, all-optical switching. The platform uses a new concept of hollow-core waveguide guided by two parallel ultra-thin layers of high index contrast grating (HCG). The HCG has an extraordinary low-loss guiding mechanism which leads to three orders of magnitude reduction in the volume of the switch medium, resulting in orders of magnitude lower switching energy, high speed and broad bandwidth. This new platform will lead to new physics and major implications for integrated optoelectronic circuits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed cross-disciplinary research will bridge between devices, systems and optical networks. The PI is a member of the Center for Integrated Access Networks, an NSF ERC with a vision is to create transformative technologies for optical access networks. This proposed research topic will enhance the on-going collaboration between PI and ERC participants. The PI has on-going collaborations with industry and international institutes for students to interact with a wide research community. These interdisciplinary collaboration will provide better preparation for students with real world applications and research experiences. The PI is active in outreaching to high school students and undergraduates from disadvantaged communities or under-represented minorities. The education program focuses on close connection between the outreach activities and cutting-edge research</AbstractNarration>
