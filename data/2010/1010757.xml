    <AbstractNarration>While it is known that mutations in DNA are the source of genetic variation in natural populations, it is unclear how changes in genes translate into the diverse forms seen in nature. To address this, the proposed research focuses on a recently evolved unique trait, a reproductive foam produced by male Japanese quail. This study will characterize gene sequences and expression patterns for genes that encode foam proteins. Data will be obtained for multiple tissues from the Japanese quail and related species. The findings will address what types of genetic changes are responsible for unique traits and how genes underlying novel structures evolve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Japanese quail is an economically important domesticated poultry species raised globally for meat and eggs. It is important to understand the fertilization biology of poultry to design efficient and effective breeding programs. When foam is added to semen, it extends the life of sperm and simulates natural fertility levels. Characterizing foam genes will increase our knowledge of the fertilization biology of quail, provide targets for selection of more fertile males, and provide insight into improving sperm function across other poultry species. Additionally, understanding the evolution of reproductive proteins may inform us about the causes of infertility.</AbstractNarration>
