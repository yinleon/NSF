    <AbstractNarration>The PI requests MRI funding to develop and evaluate the performance of a novel profiling buoy system for the calibration of satellite ocean color observations and the validation of their data products. This measurement capability is essential for creating long-term satellite climate data records of the ocean biosphere The Near Surface Profiling Buoy (NSPB), will autonomously collect 100's of high-quality, near-surface irradiance / radiance profiles during each multi-day deployment as part of a standard oceanographic research cruise. The NSPB is built upon recent advances in optical profiling instrumentation designed for turbid water environments that is adapted to the calibration and validation of ocean color satellite data. The NSPB system is aimed at making day-long to week-long deployments improving the likelihood of high quality match-ups with satellite data than is possible with conventional profiling techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased provision of sea-truth radiometry for vicarious calibration of ocean colour sensors, particularly in geographical regions not covered by existing installations, is urgently required by the remote sensing community. In principle, the buoy-plus-profiler device offers a novel and exciting technique for satisfying this need. The improved satellite validation and calibration made possible by the proposed instrumentation will likely benefit a wide group of scientists and other users. The proposed solution combines the benefits of a moored system with a boat based deployment. The buoy will be left so that it can collect large amounts of data, but not so long that bio-fouling starts to become a significant issue. In addition, the smaller overall size will reduce the infrastructure required for deployment. The proposal highlights the positive impact this development will have on a commercial company (Biospherical Instruments, Inc.).</AbstractNarration>
