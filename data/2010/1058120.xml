    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty, in the "Oxtoby Centennial Conference" that will be held at Bryn Mawr College on October 30-31, 2010. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this conference is to celebrate the legacy of John C. Oxtoby (1911-1991), a longtime faculty member at Bryn Mawr College and a driving force in the evolution of that institution's strong mathematics program. The focus of the conference is on the areas of ergodic theory and measure theory, in which Oxtoby was a figure of great influence by virtue of both his research contributions and his pioneering graduate text on measure theory. Both topics, but especially ergodic theory, remain central and extremely active subjects of current research. The format of the meeting is such that young people, including undergraduates, will have ample opportunities to speak and be otherwise engaged in the various conference activities.</AbstractNarration>
