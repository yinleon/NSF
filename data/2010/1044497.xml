    <AbstractNarration>Participating Organizations: &lt;br/&gt;Arizona State University (ASU)&lt;br/&gt;Chandler-Gilbert Community College (CGCC)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Description:&lt;br/&gt;Arizona State University (ASU), in collaboration with Chandler-Gilbert Community College (CGCC), is developing cyberlearning-based instructional materials for undergraduate electrical engineering courses on introductory linear circuit analysis. The instructional materials consist of a set of software tools for the automatic generation of specified types of circuit analysis examples and problems of carefully graded difficulty, including fully worked-out, accurate solutions. Software modules are being developed to automatically or manually sketch circuit diagrams and permit modification of the diagrams by students in order to illustrate the steps involved in working through problems. The modules also allow users to sketch waveforms using a palette of various functions in a drawing program. The software incorporates automatic evaluation of the steps in student work (i.e., equations, numerical answers, and revised circuit diagrams that they input) as well as the final answers. Algorithms and heuristics are being used to solve circuit problems as students are taught to do in elementary courses, as distinct from methods normally used in automated circuit analysis. The software can also be used to generate and grade individualized homework problems and quizzes, as well as fully-worked examples for use by students during individual or collaborative study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The software elements are also being integrated into a prototype interactive tutoring program, leveraging an existing Andes physics tutor system (as the initial framework). This work is being done in collaboration with Kurt VanLehn, who authored Andes. Instructional sequences to teach key concepts in circuit theory are being implemented using carefully programmed sequences of problems and examples exhibiting various levels of difficulty. These sequences specifically target common preconceptions/misconceptions that students tend to hold regarding electricity and circuit analysis. Instructional sequences can be automatically customized to the needs and desires of individual students to promote mastery of key concepts, while enforcing review of earlier material to increase retention. Feedback from student performance on tutorials completed prior to class is being used to identify areas in which instructors should focus during a given class period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Independent formative and summative evaluation of these materials is conducted by an educational specialist with expertise in the evaluation of computer-based learning systems. Learning gains are measured against carefully defined learning objectives (using concept inventories before &amp; after instruction), as well as student exam scores and performance (including time on task) on questions encountered in the tutoring sequences. Surveys and focus groups are also being used as part of the overall project's evaluation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance:&lt;br/&gt;The project is attempting to utilize an open-source approach to dissemination; while a web-based version of the software is also being planned for potential incorporation into a proprietary publisher web site. The project has the potential to provide a model for university &amp; community college collaboration, while also offering a technology-based tutoring approach that can be adapted to teach a variety of other key engineering courses (e.g., digital circuit design, statics). Underrepresented minority students are being actively recruited to work on the project to ensure value for all those involved in the STEM learning community.</AbstractNarration>
