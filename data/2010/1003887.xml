    <AbstractNarration>The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network will conduct a follow-up workshop to the Outreach Forum the QEM Network conducted for Hispanic-serving Institutions (HSIs) on September 25-26, 2009, in Albuquerque, NM. The goals of the Outreach Forum were to assist the Foundation in gathering broadly representative, informed, and comprehensive input regarding essential program components and requirements for an HSI-STEM initiative. Participants in the follow-up workshop will include the science, technology, engineering&lt;br/&gt;and mathematics (STEM) faculty from the 69 Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs) who participated in the HSI Outreach Forum as well as STEM faculty from an additional 15 HSIs not represented at the Outreach Forum that also have not received significant support from NSF but have at least one active award from the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR). As in the Outreach Forum, each institution will be represented by a two-person STEM faculty team, at least one of whom must be female.</AbstractNarration>
