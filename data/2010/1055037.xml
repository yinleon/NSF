    <AbstractNarration>The project is to develop a state-of-the-art liquid nitrogen storage facility for the Museum of Zoology (UMMZ) at the University of Michigan. The two year project involves the acquisition and installation of the liquid nitrogen freezers, inventory and transfer of previously accessioned tissues from old -80 degree C ultralow freezers to new -190 degree C liquid nitrogen freezers, and accession and transfer of a backlog of frozen tissues. The lower temperature offered by the liquid nitrogen freezers coupled with a static holding time of eight days will ensure both higher quality and safer long-term storage of tissues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UMMZ is an internationally recognized center of biodiversity research and teaching. It houses a Development of a Liquid Nitrogen Storage Facility for Frozen Tissues at the University of large collection of animals and associated materials, including frozen tissue, representing all primary global ecosystems. The collections provide data that inform conservation practices and climate change research. Five of the six Divisions (Fishes, Mollusks, Herpetology, Birds and Mammals) maintain frozen tissue collections totaling over 36,500 specimens. They serve as an important source of genetic material for biodiversity research and are utilized by researchers from all over the world. The proposed accessioning activities associated with this grant will immediately result in increased use of the resource.</AbstractNarration>
