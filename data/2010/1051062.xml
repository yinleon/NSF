    <AbstractNarration>This project is adopting and adapting a recently-developed National Earth Science Teachers Association (NESTA) website template to transition two state-level (California and Michigan) ESTA websites into redesigned and expanded web entities that reflect the respective state education standards. The project is also evaluating and refining the process, training, and support needed to accomplish the transition in order to establish how to best offer, at reasonable cost and with maximum efficiency, such services to other state-level ESTAs in the future. The project is providing training and support to volunteer ESTA leaders in two target states, and is significantly enhancing the ability of these organizations to provide resources to their members. Because the state ESTA websites are linked to the national NESTA website, the project also is helping to enhance the widespread sharing of educational materials and other information among the community of earth science educators in the US.</AbstractNarration>
