    <AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the Center for Plant Cell Biology (CEPCEB) at the University of California-Riverside (UCR) to provide research training for 10 weeks for 12 students, during the summers of 2010-2014. This award is supported by the Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences. The scientific focus of the program is on the cellular and molecular biology of plants and plant pathogens. Training will be provided to a broad range of students from both two- and four-year colleges, including those from institutions that offer limited research opportunities and members of groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. The program begins with one week of lectures and exercises that introduce the basics of molecular and cell biology, and topics in plant and pathogen biology. Each student then spends nine weeks on an independent research project in a faculty laboratory. Professional skills will be enhanced by a scholarly writing project, a poster session presentation based on the individual student research project, and participation in a seminar series. Students will also attend workshops that address topics such as how to gain admission to graduate school, scientific ethics and the responsible conduct of research, and career options in various science-affiliated fields. Participants will learn to work in a professional environment, gain increased confidence in themselves, and improve their skills in communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving. The program will be evaluated using a common assessment tool, and the career outcomes of participants will be tracked. Inquiries about the program may be made to Professor Howard Judelson (howard.judelson@ucr.edu, 951-827-4199) or by visiting the program's web site at: http://genomics.ucr.edu/reu.php.</AbstractNarration>
