    <AbstractNarration>Project Goal: The Goal: The Fort Peck Math and Science Network goal is to build Fort Peck Reservation Assiniboine and Sioux students? science and math knowledge and capacities and provide students access to STEM career pathways. Fort Peck Community College and four reservation high schools Brockton, Frazer, Poplar and Wolf Point are partners in the Fort Peck Math and Science Network. Tribal College students, 435 total, and five hundred high school students will have active learning experiences in science and computer-assisted mathematics throughout the grant period. The aim is to raise the Moncas science and math scores at the 16th percentile (average 2 year trend) up to the 50th percentile, and open the STEM pipeline for Assiniboine and Sioux students to enter STEM degree programs at Fort Peck Community College.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 1: A comprehensive foundation of mathematics skills, knowledge and capacities will be built in high school and college students on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, through the implementation of the ALEKS computer assisted math learning system as indicated by Moncas math test scores and college freshman placement ASSET test results. Objective 2: Science instruction for all high school and college students on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation will feature active learning as forty percent of the entire learning experience to raised Moncas science scores. Objective 3: The Network partners will expand math and science instruction through designated learning labs on all campuses, for maximum access to active learning instructional activities in science and computer assisted curriculum in mathematics. Objective 4: Highly qualified senior principal investigators and the Network STEM Faculty Steering Committee will manage the Fort Peck Math and Science Network; summative and formative project evaluations will be performed semiannually during the project period, for continuous improvement.</AbstractNarration>
