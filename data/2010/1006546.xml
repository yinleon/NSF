    <AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract: Soft materials are easily deformed, and their fundamental properties are often defined by their susceptibility to deformation. Deformation can occur on many length scales, defining the unique properties of a soft material. The proposed research is centered on investigation of soft materials where the basic components of the material are themselves deformable. For example, dispersions of microgel particles which can be deformed by compression, squeezing the fluid out of the particles will be probed to explore new dynamic behavior and to investigate possible crystallization. The unusual properties of biomolecular networks, which exhibit history-dependent mechanics resulting from stretching of the filaments due to deformation; will be investigated with a combination of imaging and rheology. New soft materials will be made using the exquisite precision of microfluidics, and methods to scale up the production to yield useful quantities of material will be developed. The research will be carried out in a highly collaborative, interdisciplinary environment that provides high quality training for the next generation of scientists and engineers that will provide the manpower for our nation's economic competitiveness. Much of the work will be done in collaboration with industry, and jobs will continue to be created by the success of the start-up companies that are created with the help of the support from the NSF. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract: Soft materials are those that are very easily deformed by small forces. They are typically solids, but they can change in shape or even flow when small forces are applied. For example, a foam such as shaving cream, is made from water and air; however, mixing a liquid and a gas together produces a material that is a solid. But, it is a weak solid, that can also easily flow as happens, for example, when it is used for its intended purpose of helping to lubricate a razor blade. Thus, like all soft materials, both it solid-like and its fluid-like properties are important. This research will develop new methods to explore such materials, and will investigate the properties of these new materials. The results of the research will lead to new, fundamental understanding of the materials. This understanding will be applied to help learn about important biological materials, such as that which forms the cartilage so essential in the functioning of our knees. In addition, new materials will be created that have technological uses for applications including drug delivery or protection of active ingredients in foods and person care products. The research will be carried out in collaboration with industry, and will help train the next generation of scientists and engineers that will power the economic competitiveness of our nation. In addition, the technology developed will continue to form the basis of start-up companies, that are already providing new high-quality jobs.</AbstractNarration>
