    <AbstractNarration>Improving Power Quality and Safety Operation of Multiple Grid-Connected Residential Photovoltaic (PV) Systems with Distributed Storage, Control and Power Conditioning Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop advanced technologies to solve the widely-recognized but yet unsolved technical issues for multiple residential photovoltaic (PV) systems when they are connected to the grid. The approach is to integrate a local energy storage device to a PV system by using a cascaded multi-level circuit configuration, design control strategy to achieve both dispatching power and enhanced voltage regulation capability, develop the effective model of energy storage device to enhance the power management and increase lifetime, and build a power hardware-in-the-loop test bed so the developed converter hardware can be evaluated under a system environment emulated using software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: This project brings together two investigators from different areas in a well integrated project. By combining the complementary expertise of each investigator in power electronics and energy storage areas, the advantages of storage integrated PV systems can be fully exploited to enhance the power quality of the grid as well as the safety operation, which are essential for higher penetration of residential PV systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact: The developed technology will help to boost a large installation of PV systems in the residential sector; This research will also help to reduce the peak power demand of the grid and smart self-management of local energy, thus assisting in the development of future smart grids; The research will provide useful guidelines for the increased integration of other distributed energy sources into the electrical grid, therefore help promote a greater and more reliable renewable energy market penetration; The education plan will help to educate a new workforce in the renewable energy field, especially in support of local green businesses, and expose the research results to K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>
