    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award is to acquire an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM)at Lawrence Technological University. The environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) is a powerful materials research tool that permits the study of wet, oily, porous and soft materials which are traditionally considered impossible to study using conventional microscopy techniques. The acquisition of an ESEM system at Lawrence Technological University will greatly enhance a wide array of ongoing research activities at Lawrence Tech and its partnering institutions in the metro Detroit area. This includes the characterization of novel biomaterials, microfabricated medical devices and orthopedic implants at Lawrence Tech, William Beaumont Hospital, and Wayne State University; the study of carbon nanotube-reinforced cement based materials and fracture analysis of concrete exposed to fire at Lawrence Tech, the characterization of novel surface coatings and lubricants for the development of new vehicles with more efficient engine/transmission components at Oakland University, and the study of novel electrode materials for the development of next generation lithium ion batteries at General Motors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once this ESEM is acquired and operational, results from the research projects it will support will be published and disseminated to stimulate further understanding and progress in the various research areas of the investigators in this proposal. The ESEM will strengthen the existing materials research infrastructure at Lawrence Tech and its partnering institutions, and enhance the research and educational experiences of a large number of students at Lawrence Tech and other universities. The development of laboratory sessions with hands-on experience of using this ESEM for a variety of outreach programs will strength Lawrence Tech?s leading role in the metro Detroit area to increase the number of women and underrepresented students entering science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
