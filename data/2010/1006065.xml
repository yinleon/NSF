    <AbstractNarration>****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;Graphene is a novel carbon material consisting of one-atom thick sheets of carbon. Discovered in 2004, this material holds great promise for electronic applications ranging from transparent conducting films (used in solar cells) to ultra-high-speed transistors. This individual investigator award supports a research project at a predominately undergraduate institution that will investigate how rapidly the conductivity of graphene can be varied, which is relevant to the development of high-speed graphene-based electronics. It is expected that the conductivity of graphene can change on very fast timescales. To investigate the fast change in conductivity, the graphene sample will be excited with an ultra-short pulse of light and subsequently the resulting change in conductivity will be measured with an ultra-short pulse of terahertz radiation. Conductivity measurements under a range of conditions will enable the isolation of the fundamental processes, which control the electronic properties of graphene. This research will also serve to train undergraduate science students in Photonics and experimental Condensed Matter Physics. During the past 15 years, the investigator's laboratory has trained 35 advanced undergraduates, more than two thirds of whom have pursued graduate degrees in Science, Mathematics or Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****&lt;br/&gt;Graphene shows exceptional promise as an electronic material for nanoscale transistors and high-speed electronics. This individual investigator award supports a project that will study carrier dynamics in graphene and ultra-thin graphite using time-resolved THz spectroscopy. Conducting films of graphene flakes can now be easily produced from graphene oxide and from graphene solutions. Time resolved THz and infrared spectroscopy are well-suited tools for studying the electronic properties of these flakes. These measurements use an optical or infrared pump pulse to excite a sample and a delayed THz pulse to probe the resulting transient change in conductivity. The research is expected to determine the electron and hole scattering rates, lifetimes and mobilities in graphene flakes formed by mechanical or chemical exfoliation of graphite. In this way the measurements will help probe the suitability of these materials for a variety of applications from transparent conducting films to transistors. The research program will also provide education and research training opportunities for advanced undergraduate students. During the past 15 years, the investigator's laboratory has trained 35 advanced undergraduates, more than two thirds of whom have pursued graduate degrees in Science, Mathematics or Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
