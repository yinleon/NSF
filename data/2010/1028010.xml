    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harvesting useful electric energy from ambient thermal gradients and/or fluctuations is immensely important. Usually, direct thermoelectric energy conversion is based on the Seebeck effect. However, thermal shorting limits the energy conversion efficiency&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To develop advanced energy harvesting systems, a novel concept using nanoporous materials, which was recently developed in our lab, will be investigated. If two nanoporous electrodes are placed at different temperatures, they absorb different amounts of ions, generating a net output voltage. The thermally driven ion motion causes a transient current. The two electrodes are isolated; that is, the direct heat loss between them is minimized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study will not only lead to the development of high-performance thermal energy harvesting systems, but also shed light on fundamentals of electrophysics. The thermal effect on surface electrification in nanopores is a new scientific area. The research will lead to the establishment of counterparts of classic electrophysics theories for nanoenvironment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will also provide an important support to the author?s pedagogical efforts. Video of experiments and visualized computer simulation modules will be used in a number of undergraduate and graduate courses, as well as in a series of seminars, having considerable impact on the curriculum. Female students and under-represented minorities will be encouraged to attend the seminars and take the courses. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be actively involved in the project and acquire comprehensive hands-on research experience.</AbstractNarration>
