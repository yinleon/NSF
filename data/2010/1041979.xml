    <AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry supports Bradford Perkins of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. Perkins will work with Prof. Keith Nelson to investigate the flow of vibrational energy in condensed-phase systems. In particular, the research will use ultrafast terahertz methods to probe the flow of energy from low-energy phonon modes into higher-energy molecular vibrational modes, which ultimately leads to bond-breaking events (chemistry). The work will be carried out in collaboration with scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory. For his plan for broadening participation, the PI will engage Boston-area high school students, particularly those from groups underrepresented in science, in terahertz imaging research as part of the "Lambda Project."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that of Dr. Perkins is aimed at developing a better understanding of the mechanism of how energy flows in molecular materials. In particular, the research carried out with support from this award will reveal the step-by-step mechanisms of how energy moves from a low-energy form to a higher energy form that is capable of leading to chemical reaction -- research that is important in understanding thermally-initiated processes. Results from research like that supported here will lead to better computational models and new kinds of materials, e.g. explosives, outcomes which are of importance to national security. The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Perkins are aimed at encouraging young people, especially those from groups underrepresented in the sciences, to pursue higher education in science, by providing exposure to the excitement of laboratory research in a modern research environment.</AbstractNarration>
