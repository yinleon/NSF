    <AbstractNarration>Water distribution systems are complex engineered systems in which biological and chemical reactions occur within a physical network of pipes, pumps, and tanks. Because safe drinking water is critical to maintaining public health and national security, engineering students need to understand the dynamics of water distribution systems. This project is developing and testing modules and kits for a Water Distribution System Analysis Lab. These kits and modules are being developed to increase students' understanding by providing systematic information and interdisciplinary concepts associated with the biological, chemical, and hydraulic dynamics in water distribution systems. This lab introduces students to real world problems by adapting and implementing problem-based learning modules with real-life context and by applying computational techniques to hydraulics and water quality simulations. These kits and modules are being designed for use from pre-college through graduate programs, as well as by organizations such as Engineers without Borders.</AbstractNarration>
