    <AbstractNarration>The project objective is to elucidate how in the choroid plexus zinc, an essential mineral protects against modulation of choline transport by oxidative stress that is induced by the contaminant heavy metal, cadmium. Neurons in the brain are responsive and vulnerable to changes in nutrient availability. Choline is a vital nutrient, necessary for synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and cell membranes of neuronal cells; however, in high concentrations choline can inhibit neuron activity. The choroid plexus, which forms the barrier between cerebrospinal fluid and blood, transports choline and thus regulates choline availability in the brain. Stressors such hyperthermia or environmental contaminants may markedly alter choline transport by choroid plexus. Radiotracer, biochemical, molecular biological, immunochemical and fluorescence microscopy techniques will be used to characterize cellular and molecular mechanisms by which zinc protects the choroid plexus against oxidative stress induced by cadmium and stress modulation of choline transport. Heavy metals in the environment threaten animal and human populations. Because at low doses, cadmium and other heavy metals accumulate in choroid plexus, this work will increase the understanding of how heavy metals modulate choline transport by choroid plexus and in turn alter choline availability in the brain. This work also will elucidate how zinc status may influence the basic biology and physiology of the choroid plexus. Roughly 20% of the U.S. and world populations are zinc deficient. This work will elucidate how zinc status influences the susceptibility of choroid plexus to oxidative stress and stress induced modulation of choline transport and thus help to maintain choline availability in the brain. Educational objectives include increasing retention of Hispanic, Afro-American, and first-generation university students in the biological sciences. Undergraduate student research activities will encourage pursuit of graduate degrees in biology or related sciences and thus, increase diversity in science.</AbstractNarration>
