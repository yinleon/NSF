    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for the sixth annual UNCG Regional Mathematics and Statistics Conference, to be held November 5-6, 2010 at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference promotes education and research in the field of mathematics and statistics specifically tailored for undergraduate and graduate students to present results of their research and to allow students of all levels (high-school, undergraduate, graduate) to interact with and learn from each other. Moreover, faculty mentors and high-school teachers will have an opportunity to observe and network with peers and find possible collaborators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there are various programs across the nation geared towards high-school students, this conference will provide them an opportunity to actively participate in a conference. They will be introduced to current interesting topics in mathematics and statistics by undergraduate and graduate students making it seem more accessible than being introduced by faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In regard to broadening the participation of underrepresented groups, it is estimated that women and minorities (who are currently underrepresented in mathematical research) will account for around half of the participants who will be funded by this project. Students from these underrepresented groups will be especially encouraged to participate in the conference and to apply for funding.</AbstractNarration>
