    <AbstractNarration>Biological collections whether from the recent or geologic past provide a unique tool to investigate the changing patterns of diversity and responses to global changes, such as climate change. This project will protect and provide open access to a rare collection for both research and education. It is a series of historic recent and fossil collections held in the Non-vertebrate paleontology repository of the Texas Natural Science Center. Many of these specimens are fragile, currently located in unsuitable storage conditions with much of their related data written on deteriorating paper labels. This project will conserve and relocate that material. Key specimens will be digitally imaged along with related labels, field notes or diagrams. All information about the specimens, including collection localities, will added to an NSF-sponsored open source database and be made accessible via the web, where the user can view all or query for specific groups or time frames, and map their selections on Google Earth against today's geography or that of the relevant time frame in geologic history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specimens of recent age, such as freshwater mussels and snails, and terrestrial snails, collected in the late 19th century are keys to patterns of change occurring today, markers against which modern surveys can be compared. Shell chemistries are potential future resources for environmental indicators. Older fossil specimens come from other periods of climate change, such as 55 million years ago at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary; these specimens are invaluable resources for scientists examining the current climate changes. The data gathered will be used as an integral educational resource developed on both popular and open source mobile media platforms. Collaboration with skilled information scientists and their students will help the development of digital field trips, fossil keys and other interactive tools to excite and inform students and members of the public. For many minority groups a phone is their only access to the internet.</AbstractNarration>
