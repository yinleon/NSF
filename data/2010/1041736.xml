    <AbstractNarration>This award will support two important workshops to bring together space weather stakeholders from industry, academia, and government agencies. Space Weather Week is held annually in Boulder, Colorado. It has evolved into the Nation?s leading conference on all issues relating to space weather. The presentations, poster sessions, and discussions are important for the advancement of knowledge, understanding and needs of the space weather research community. It provides a mechanism to generate actionable information to drive improved space weather science, products, services and application to serve a broad user community. The workshop also fosters coordinated interagency approaches to space weather education and outreach that will lead to better informed decisions regarding support for space weather research and operations. The Space Weather Enterprise Forum is held annually in Washington, DC. It brings together members of government at all levels, the private sector, and academia, to raise awareness, improve understanding, and educate all participants on opportunities, needs and priorities related to space weather. The forum focuses on the costs of space weather impacts and the benefits of improved space weather services with an emphasis on the anticipated needs of the user community in 2010 to 2020. Space weather scientists and service providers seek to better understand and serve society?s needs for space weather information. The desired outcome is actionable information to drive improved space weather science, products, services, and applications to serve a broad user community.</AbstractNarration>
