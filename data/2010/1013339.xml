    <AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the relationship between spatiotemporal variation of vegetation patterns and desertification probabilities in systems exhibiting patterned vegetation for current and projected future climates. Three hypotheses frame the scientific scope of the project: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;H1: In isolation, a) increased CO2 concentrations shift patterns towards a homogeneous vegetated condition; b) increased vapor pressure deficit shift patterns towards desertified conditions. H2: A length-scale threshold exists below which spatial variability (e.g. in soil patterns) acts as additive noise to vegetation patterns. Above this threshold, the properties of the vegetation pattern depend on both the dynamics of the pattern forming processes, and the wavelength of the spatial variation. H3: Temporal stochasticity in rainfall will blur sharp transitions to desertification predicted by mean-field theory into a "basin" of desertification probabilities. Three tasks are proposed to address these three hypotheses: Task 1: Model Development and Forward Modeling, intended to extend existing models and evaluate them at four data-rich study locations in Africa, the USA and Australia, along with assessing the implications of spatiotemporal variability on pattern morphology and desertification risk; Task 2: Remote Sensing Imagery Acquisition, Processing and Analysis, intended to support the modeling efforts in Tasks 1 and 3, and to assess the drivers of spatial variation in pattern morphology; Task 3: Inverse Modeling, incorporating the development of parameter estimation techniques, their application to synthetic pattern time series and ultimately to observations from case study sites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a proof of concept, the investigators will initially develop an inverse modeling methodology using a phenomenological model (c.f. Lefever and Lejeune) with a reduced parameter space. They will then proceed to a full mechanistic inverse model that will draw on a detailed meta-analysis from the literature on stomatal and biochemical responses of plants under soil moisture stress to strongly constrain the physiological parameters. The proposed image analysis task (Task 2 above, initially focused on spectral techniques) will be extended to evaluate the suitability of a range of pattern identification techniques (including methods that rely on dimension reduction such as POD and wavelet thresholding) to discriminate different features of vegetation patterning over multiple spatial scales. The kernel-based approaches proposed here are non-Fickian and permit heavy-tailed seed dispersal kernels. Time delays can be explored by allowing the seed source function to become time dependent. The researchers have conducted extensive simulations using simplified routing schemes to identify key processes and sensitivities (which relate largely to surface roughness as a means of sustaining vegetation patterning). Extensive literature searches indicate a number of suitable datasets examining flow velocities, runoff coefficients and runoff scaling in patchy landscapes. We will draw on these datasets for model validation.</AbstractNarration>
