    <AbstractNarration>Modern distributed systems are extremely complex, due in large part to&lt;br/&gt;individual node complexity, node unreliability and asynchrony, and&lt;br/&gt;unpredictable network message delays and orderings. Further complicating&lt;br/&gt;development of these systems is both the presence of multiple potentially&lt;br/&gt;incompatible versions of the systems, and the need to build correct systems&lt;br/&gt;also exhibiting high performance. Prior testing and simulation frameworks are&lt;br/&gt;characterized either by extensive manual effort, or automated search for&lt;br/&gt;violations of a binary decision problem---the presence or absence of a bug. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are developing automated and interactive techniques for helping developers&lt;br/&gt;understand the behavior of distributed systems implementations. By leveraging&lt;br/&gt;the evolved frameworks, and instrumenting implementations in structured,&lt;br/&gt;straightforward ways, we are building development tools focused on&lt;br/&gt;understanding system behavior rather than merely identifying correctness&lt;br/&gt;errors. This change in focus will enable more general tools that improve&lt;br/&gt;development productivity in addition to testing productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is proceeding on three fronts: 1) developing automated tools &lt;br/&gt;using data mining with repeated executions to extract execution behaviors and&lt;br/&gt;performance, 2) developing flexible execution descriptions suitable for both&lt;br/&gt;use-case descriptions and automated processing, allowing more intuitive&lt;br/&gt;interaction between users and their tools, and 3) incorporating testing tools&lt;br/&gt;with revision control systems, enabling multi-version analysis and long-term&lt;br/&gt;progress tracking. When completed, this research will reduce developer effort&lt;br/&gt;necessary to design, update, and debug distributed systems, and may inspire&lt;br/&gt;creation of a new class of systems debuggers analysing not just correctness,&lt;br/&gt;but also performance and complexity.</AbstractNarration>
