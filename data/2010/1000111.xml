    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this project is to investigate a new reactor design, called a continuous flow microreactor, to deposit materials from water-based solutions. This design reduces the critical dimension of the reactor from the centimeter-scale used in conventional solution reactors to sub-millimeter scale in order to improve reactant utilization and reduce waste. The microreactor will be used to synthesize semiconductor and oxide thin films and nanowire arrays that are important to the solar cell industry. The understanding developed through this project has potential both to reduce the cost of current solar cells and to enable next-generation solar cell designs. The microreactor will be used to investigate reaction mechanisms and to identify the physical processes that limit deposition rates. Additionally, it will enable discovery of new materials with optimal functional properties for photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The continuous flow microreactor will improve process yields and reduce waste by up to a factor of ten, which will reduce manufacturing costs significantly and could have transformative impact on the semiconductor processing industry. As the thin film photovoltaics market continues to grow, low-cost "green" deposition methods will become increasingly important, and the advantages in yield, waste reduction, and cost offered by the microreactor will be extremely valuable. In addition to its industrial impact, this project will also result in the research education and training of a PhD student and several undergraduate students. High school students and teachers will also participate through summer research experiences.</AbstractNarration>
