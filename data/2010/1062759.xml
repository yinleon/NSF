    <AbstractNarration>A big theme in number theory in the last 50 years has been the relationship&lt;br/&gt;between automorphic forms, Galois representations and objects from algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry. There is an extensive web of extraordinary conjectures (for instance&lt;br/&gt;the Artin conjecture, the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture, Langlands' conjectures,&lt;br/&gt;Serre's conjecture and the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture) linking these&lt;br/&gt;three seemingly very different subjects (which relate to analysis, algebra and&lt;br/&gt;geometry respectively). Progress on these conjectures is currently very exciting.&lt;br/&gt;Under previous NSF grants the PI, with various collaborators, completed&lt;br/&gt;the proof of the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture; proved the local Langlands&lt;br/&gt;conjecture for GL(n) over a p-adic field; proved the Sato-Tate conjecture for&lt;br/&gt;elliptic curves over totally real fields; proved the first general automorphy lifting&lt;br/&gt;theorems and potential automorphy theorems for Galois representations&lt;br/&gt;of arbitrary dimension; and proved that the L-function of any polarized, regular,&lt;br/&gt;irreducible motive over a CM field has meromorphic continuation to the&lt;br/&gt;whole complex plane and satisfies the expected functional equation. The PI&lt;br/&gt;proposes to continue to improve the currently available automorphy lifting&lt;br/&gt;and potential automorphy theorems; to relate the cohomology of Rapoport-&lt;br/&gt;Zink spaces to the local Langlands conjecture for groups other than GL(n); with&lt;br/&gt;Kevin Buzzard and Joe Rabinoff to prove the Artin conjecture for odd degree&lt;br/&gt;two representations of the Galois group of a totally real field in which 5 splits&lt;br/&gt;completely; and to think about more speculative problems relating Galois representations and automorphic forms, for instance how to understand the case of very degenerate Hodge-Tate numbers/infinitesimal character. In addition the PI will continue his work with post-docs and, particularly, with graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This circle of ideas is the one that led to Andrew Wiles' celebrated proof of&lt;br/&gt;Fermat's last theorem after over 300 years. They fall into the general area of&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic geometry - a subject that blends two of the oldest areas of mathematics:&lt;br/&gt;number theory and geometry. This combination has proved extraordinarily&lt;br/&gt;fruitful. Among its many consequences are new error correcting codes.&lt;br/&gt;Such codes are essential for both modern computers (hard disks) and compact&lt;br/&gt;disks.</AbstractNarration>
