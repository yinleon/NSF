    <AbstractNarration>This project is a combined experimental and theoretical study of the stability of interfaces between elastomers and stiff materials (such as glass and metals). The central objective is to identify critical parameters (such as adhesion energy, pressures and dimensions) that control thin film debonding in the presence of different fluidic environments. The results will then be used to identify geometries and surface treatments that improve reliability and performance in fluidic bioanalytical microdevices. The approach is to create micropatterned channels that are capped by elastomer films: interface stability will then be quantified (using optical and interferometric measurements) as different fluids are injected into the channels. This study will include the characterization of interfaces in existing devices that perform DNA extraction, amplification and detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The insights generated by this program will provide societal benefits by enabling the development microdevices that perform biochemical manipulations for genomic and proteomic analysis. The ability to control interface stability will not only improve device reliability, but also enable simplified fluidic flow control using passive features that open and close based on tailored interface behavior (as opposed to direct mechanical actuation). This development will facilitate both scientific discovery (by broadening the range of fluidic manipulations at the microscale) and the targeted development of portable devices for clinical applications. The project also bears direct relevance for flexible "macroelectronics", e.g. video displays that are created by depositing electronic features on flexible elastomer substrates. The project will integrate research and education by placing research devices in undergraduate laboratories focusing on design, rapid prototyping, material properties, dynamics and chemical separations.</AbstractNarration>
