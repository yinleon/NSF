    <AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this project is to explore the radio frequency (RF) signal processing and sensing properties of optomechanically-coupled systems in the context of radiation pressure driven optomechanical oscillator (OMO). Specifically, the nonlinear dynamics of a microtoroid OMO will be studied in the presence of modulated optical pump and external perturbation. We will use the outcomes of the theoretical and experimental investigation to develop OMO based RF signal processors and biochemical sensors. Additionally, to support this primary goal we will demonstrate a novel hybrid optomechanical oscillator with enhanced performance and integration techniques that for the first time enable demonstration of fully integrated and efficient OMO based systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: New aspects of the nonlinear dynamics of an OMO will be investigated that can be exploited for practical applications such as homodyne RF down conversion and molecule detection. The idea of hybrid OMO proposed here will enable low power and low phase noise optomechanical oscillation at high frequencies. Also the proposed research aims to develop a new class of sensors based on simultaneous optical and mechanical monitoring using high quality OMO. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The multidisciplinary nature of this project stimulates collaboration among different departments at University of New Mexico. The PI has developed plans for collaboration with minority serving colleges and to reach out K-12 and post-secondary teachers and students. The principles and systems explored in this project will benefit the society through improvement of future RF-photonic communication systems and development of a new class of integrated biochemical sensors.</AbstractNarration>
