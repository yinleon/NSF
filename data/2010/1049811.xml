    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a five day interactive workshop entitled "Surpassing Evolution: Transformative Approaches to Enhance the Efficiency of Photosynthesis" which will take place in Pacific Grove, California at the Asilomar Conference Grounds from September 12-17th, 2010. The workshop is being planned and organized by five expert mentors in the field with logistical support provided by California State University, Fullerton. There will be approximately 45 attending, including up to 30 participants in addition to mentors, guests, and facilitators. The chosen participants are comprised of outstanding scientists in the diverse areas of photosynthesis from both the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). A unique feature of the workshop is the inclusion of expert facilitators to assist in the design, development, and facilitation of the workshop using Creative Problem Solving (CPS) methodology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The processes of photosynthesis form the basis of energy capture from the sun in plants, algae, and microorganisms and is thus of critical importance for life on earth. Harnessing the energy of the sun for food production, renewable energy, and carbon sequestration is of even greater significance now given the growing world population, global warning from the burning of non renewable fossil fuels, and the recent tragic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. However, while intensive research efforts have contributed to a detailed picture of some of the important molecular features and events of photosynthesis, this knowledge has not translated to significant gains in photosynthetic efficiency and yield. The key objective of this workshop is to stimulate innovative and transformative research ideas and approaches for the enhancement of photosynthesis. New basic science approaches within the framework of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary efforts are clearly warranted in order to move forward. This outcome will be achieved by bringing together the US and UK researchers to form interdisciplinary teams. With the assistance of mentors and facilitators in a secluded and creative environment, the participants will spend time data gathering, problem framing, generating ideas, creating solutions, and action planning towards the goal of crafting competitive research proposals. The projects that emerge from the Ideas Lab will lead to a more detailed understanding of photosynthesis on multiple levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The successful engineering of photosynthetic processes has great potential to contribute to solutions in a number of vital areas of international concern, including the food supply, renewable energy, and global warming, impacting applied areas of research such as agricultural and environmental biotechnology. The Ideas Lab will foster both international collaboration and modern interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research and contribute to the effective training of the next generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>
