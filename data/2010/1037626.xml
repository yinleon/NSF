    <AbstractNarration>College of Menominee Nation (CMN), together with the University of Wisconsin Madison and the &lt;br/&gt;University of Wisconsin Platteville, is applying to the National Science Foundations Science, Tribal &lt;br/&gt;Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) Pre-engineering Education Collaborative grant to strengthen &lt;br/&gt;CMN?s capacity to establish CMN as an Associate Degree granting engineering program of distinction. . &lt;br/&gt;The CMN PEEC: Providing for the Education of American Indian Engineers collaborative project &lt;br/&gt;proposes the following objectives: &lt;br/&gt;&amp;#61607; To build CMN?s capacity and infrastructure to sustain a Pre-engineering Associate Degree Program. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;#61607; To implement a Pre-engineering program of distinction. &lt;br/&gt;&amp;#61607; By September 2015, to graduate at least twenty students from CMN?s pre-engineering program and &lt;br/&gt; transition into U.W. Madison?s and U.W. Platteville?s engineering programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Intellectual Merit: This project recognizes and embraces diversity and the role Tribal Colleges &lt;br/&gt;play in coordinating demonstrative research on increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities &lt;br/&gt;in STEM fields. Tribal Colleges are key contributors to the body of knowledge on American Indians. &lt;br/&gt;Project research, data, and outcomes focused in the ultimate outcomes of increasing the number of and &lt;br/&gt;performance of American Indian students in engineering, leading to increased numbers of American &lt;br/&gt;Indians in engineering careers, will provide key nationally recognized research. This collaboration will &lt;br/&gt;develop, apply and assess evidence-based practices shown to increase the participation of &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented minority students in science and engineering. Furthermore, the partnership between &lt;br/&gt;CMN and its UW partners is tailored to establish robust connections between institutions that will serve as &lt;br/&gt;a model for the engineering community in general and other minority-serving institutions as we assess, &lt;br/&gt;document and disseminate the success of this process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Broader Impact: This project will build upon the research of previous STEM activities, continuing &lt;br/&gt;the investigation of essential research in discovering and understanding how Tribal Colleges and the &lt;br/&gt;unique strategies they implement promote education in minority students. The project further advances &lt;br/&gt;the research of American Indian undergraduate education in engineering and contributes to the global &lt;br/&gt;body of knowledge in underrepresented minority engineering education. The short term outcome of this &lt;br/&gt;effort will be to increase the knowledge, understanding and interest in engineering among students in &lt;br/&gt;rural populations, with emphasis on the American Indian population of Northern Wisconsin. The long &lt;br/&gt;term outcome will be an increase in the participation of American Indian students graduating with degrees &lt;br/&gt;in engineering. This will ensure that the voices, perspectives and talents of a population that is so &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented in engineering have an opportunity to contribute to the development of the engineering &lt;br/&gt;profession.</AbstractNarration>
