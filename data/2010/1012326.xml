    <AbstractNarration>Professor Eugene Y. Chen of Colorado State University is supported by the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry to explore the scope and potential of the asymmetric coordination polymerization (ACP) catalysis of polar vinyl monomers. The project advances four main objectives: (1) to develop kinetic resolution polymerization for the simultaneous synthesis of chiral polymers and the resolution of racemic monomers; (2) to further develop catalytic asymmetric coordination polymerization; (3) to investigate the resolution of racemic catalysts by chiral anions into ACP catalysts; and (4) to investigate the synthesis of helical polymer-supported chiral organic catalysts. Synthetic, catalytic, mechanistic, and computational methods will be employed to accomplish the above stated objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The synthesis of polymers of industrial importance from environmentally sustainable raw materials offers an attractive alternative to polymers derived from petrochemical sources. The proposed catalytic system offers significant advantages over existing polymerization processes for the production of important chiral polymers, including chiral polymers derived from biorenewable butyrolactone-based monomers. Students, including women and minorities, will be trained in sophisticated experimental and theoretical methodologies in organic synthesis, catalysis, and organometallic chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
