    <AbstractNarration>Where divergent evolutionary lineages come into geographic contact and have the opportunity to interbreed, they often remain distinct because of genetic differences that reduce the probability of successful mating between lineages or reduce the fitness of hybrid offspring. Speciation is the process by which lineages diverge and become reproductively isolated and is the basis for the accumulation of biodiversity. A complete understanding of speciation requires knowledge of the genetic basis and evolution of reproductive isolation. The proposed research will characterize the genetic basis and evolution of reproductive isolation between the butterfly species Lycaeides idas and L. melissa. The goals of this research are to determine the number, distribution, and effects of genetic regions isolating these species, and the role of natural selection in their divergence. Genetic regions associated with reproductive isolation will be identified using novel statistical analyses of gene flow in populations with hybrids between the two species. These genetic regions will then be contrasted with regions showing evidence of natural selection in geographically isolated populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide insight into the genetic basis of reproductive isolation and the role of natural selection in the speciation process. The project will further develop statistical methods for evolutionary genetics, which will be made available to the scientific community as computer software. Participation of undergraduates and K-12 teachers in the research will be a priority and will involve computational work with participants in the University of Wyoming summer bioinformatics program and fieldwork with local teachers.</AbstractNarration>
