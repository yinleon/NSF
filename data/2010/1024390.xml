    <AbstractNarration>SES-1024390&lt;br/&gt;Mark Fossett&lt;br/&gt;Wenquan Zhang&lt;br/&gt;Texas A&amp;M University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Residential segregation between racial and socioeconomic groups is a striking, enduring feature of urban areas in the United States and it is linked with disadvantages in life chances for vulnerable populations, particularly low income groups and racial minority groups. This project will improve the ability to study segregation by introducing more accurate measures that can be used over a wider range of circumstances than was previously possible. The project will establish the benefits of the new measures and conduct studies to determine whether findings from past research need to be re-considered based on results obtained using the new measures. In addition, the project will conduct detailed segregation analyses that were not feasible in the past. As an example, the project will examine racial segregation within and between socioeconomic groups in more detail and for more cities than has previously been possible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project will make it possible to measure segregation accurately over a wider range of circumstances than before. This will expand the scope of segregation studies and improve basic knowledge regarding segregation patterns. This will contribute to a better understanding of segregation and how its adverse consequences for vulnerable populations may be reduced.</AbstractNarration>
