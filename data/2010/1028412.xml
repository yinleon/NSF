    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate the materials requirements, device architecture, and processing for stretchable polymer thin film electronic devices. The research will demonstrate polymer light emitting diodes where the emissive region can be stretched by 50%. The project also investigates the mechanical compliancy of the devices with muscle contraction and for conforming onto uneven surfaces. The approach is to use stretchable polymer substrates, compliant transparent electrodes, and luminescent polymers, fabricate sandwiched structures by roll lamination, and create a p-i-n junction in a polymer thin film. The electroluminescent and photovoltaic properties of the devices will be characterized under various strain conditions to identify key issues for further enhancement of device performance. &lt;br/&gt;The project will lay the foundation for the fabrication of stretchable polymers for electronic devices. The project will provide fundamental knowledge on how large strains affect the property of p-i-n junction, the performance of the devices, and the interlayer adhesion. Polymer light emitting diodes will be demonstrated that are twice as efficient as light bulbs and can be stretched and contracted like muscle. &lt;br/&gt;The research may ultimately lead to new important products such as wearable devices, minimally invasive light sources for photodynamic therapy, and low-profile lighting devices. The products will have low cost and flexible form factors for broad market penetration and job creation. The project also offers a unique multidisciplinary research and education opportunity for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and undergraduates from materials creation and processing to device fabrication and testing.</AbstractNarration>
