    <AbstractNarration>Distributed applications require coordination between multiple nodes in a network, and they need to continue to operate correctly despite node failures. Implementation of such applications benefits from the availability of distributed primitives for commonly used distributed operations, such as clock synchronization or consensus. While most of the past distributed applications have traditionally used wired networks, there is an emerging trend towards the use of wireless networks for distributed applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this interdisciplinary project is on design, analysis and implementation of distributed primitives for wireless networks. In wireless networks, the network capacity is often quite limited. This project explores the design of efficient algorithms for distributed primitives under network capacity constraints, while exploiting wireless network capabilities such as local broadcast and physical layer adaptation. The scope of the project includes network-constrained distributed primitives for synchronization, consensus and function computation. Expected results from the project include theoretical bounds on performance of distributed primitives under network capacity constraints, design of efficient algorithms for the primitives, and practical implementations based on insights gained from the theory. Outcomes from the project are expected to allow efficient implementation of future distributed applications in resource-constrained wireless networks. The project brings together networking and distributed systems viewpoints, and is expected to yield fundamental new insights of interest to both areas. The research outcomes from this project will be disseminated via publications in technical conferences and journals, and incorporated into distributed computing and wireless networking courses.</AbstractNarration>
