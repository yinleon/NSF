    <AbstractNarration>Collections are indispensable to areas of scientific research such as systematics and evolution, ecology, and conservation. In a 36 month project, the Botany Department at The Field Museum will convert the 120,000 moss specimens from storage on sheets to enclosed packets, which due to their delicate nature; addresses the urgent concern over their long-term preservation. Mosses belong to a group of plants commonly termed "bryophytes," which are pivotal in our understanding of the origin and evolution of plants on land. Bryophytes are considered an important component of the vegetation in regions throughout the world and are of great ecological and environmental significance. The project will 1) enable the data basing and digitization of specimen data for the entire moss collection; 2) ensure the moss collection is more accessible for users both nationally and worldwide; and 3) significantly improve efficiency for collections management.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides training to staff and interns as to how to curate scientific collections. The digitization component of the project will add to the significance of the collections, making them available online to the scientific and broader community worldwide and contributing to international data basing projects, e.g., Global Biological Facility and the Encyclopedia of Life. The project also has a strong outreach strategy including contributing to Plants of the World Educator Guide by integrating content related to the digitized collection, and participating in the Educator Open House, including over 300 Chicago-area educators.</AbstractNarration>
