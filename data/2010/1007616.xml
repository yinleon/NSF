    <AbstractNarration>Long-memory is characterized by a covariance function which decreases&lt;br/&gt; slowly to zero as the lag increases. The decrease is so slow that the&lt;br/&gt; corresponding spectral density blows up at very low frequencies, a&lt;br/&gt; phenomenon also known as ``long-range dependence'' or ``1/f noise''.&lt;br/&gt; Because wavelets are associated with scaling, it is natural to&lt;br/&gt; attempt to use wavelets in order to estimate the intensity of long&lt;br/&gt; memory in time series. The advantage of wavelets on Fourier methods&lt;br/&gt; is that there is no need to difference the time series if these are&lt;br/&gt; not stationary. Fourier and wavelet techniques have been applied to&lt;br/&gt; processes with long memory that are Gaussian or linear. This study&lt;br/&gt; focuses instead on non-linear processes with long memory, for&lt;br/&gt; example, outputs of non-linear filters with Gaussian or with linear&lt;br/&gt; inputs. The goal is to derive effective techniques to estimate the&lt;br/&gt; exponents which characterize the intensity of long-memory, in these&lt;br/&gt; more realistic contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Time series are a collection of data points collected through time,&lt;br/&gt; for instance income or temperature. The dependence between these data&lt;br/&gt; points may be weak or strong. When this dependence is strong the time&lt;br/&gt; series is said to have long memory. Time series with long memory&lt;br/&gt; appear in a number of applications, for example, in economics&lt;br/&gt; and in the analysis of traffic in computer networks.&lt;br/&gt; The goal of this study is to understand their properties&lt;br/&gt; and how to estimate them.</AbstractNarration>
