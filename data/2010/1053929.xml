    <AbstractNarration>EAR Proposal# 1053929 Acquisition of a Liquid Water Isotope Analyzer for Earth and Environmental Science Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yuan, Fasong (f.yuan06@csuohio.edu) Cleveland State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant supports acquisition of a liquid water isotope analyzer, a high-tech product using a fourth-generation cavity ringdown spectroscopy technology, with capability of simultaneously measuring oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios for natural waters such as snow, rainfall, stream water, groundwater, and lake water. The instrument consists of a liquid water isotope analyzer, an autoinjector, and auxiliary supplies. The PI will use this instrument for research and training in earth and environmental sciences. Specific research projects include 1) monitoring water and nutrient flows in the Cuyahoga River and its tributaries, 2) deffentiating different source waters (snowmelt, monsoonal runoff, and groundwater) in the Pecos River, 3) collecting delta18O and deltaD data of surface waters in the San Luis Valley, and 4) investigating isotopic enrichment in lakes on the Tibetan Plateau. The instrument not only helps PI improve and increase research activities but also enhances the teaching capability for existing Earth and Environmental Science Program at Cleveland State University (CSU). The instrument will support student research training through a joint-teaching program at CSU and University of Akron (UA).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The liquid water isotope analyzer to measure oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios of natural waters simultaneously, with the capacity of running 120 samples per day. This instrument will support PI's collaborative research efforts to tackle several important environmental problems, including climate change, cultural eutrophication, and water and ecosystem sustainability at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. The instrument will also help enhance the teaching capability for existing Earth and Environmental Science Program at Cleveland State University at undergraduate and graduate levels. The instrument will be used to support student research training through a joint-teaching program at CSU and University of Akron (UA).</AbstractNarration>
