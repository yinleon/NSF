    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to create a novel, hybrid, and high performance micromachining process for electrically non-conductive brittle hard materials such as glass, quartz and certain ceramics, and to reveal the fundamental material removal mechanisms and microscopic phenomena in micromachining of these materials. The approach includes experimental observations, physics-based modeling and simulation of the material removal processes due to thermal erosion, chemical dissolution or etching, mechanical cutting, and ultrasonic tool vibration. A material removal model based on synthesizing the contributions from each of these material removal mechanisms will be written for this proposed novel micromachining process. This model will then be utilized to design and optimize a robust process for micromachining sample brittle hard materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project would widen the potential applications of micro components made of non-conductive brittle hard materials in emerging fields such as micro-fluidic systems and micro-electromechanical systems. This novel hybrid process will allow the cost effective machining of complex micro-features on many difficult-to-machine materials. The benefits of achieving these new micromachining capabilities include the creation of new and better devices for biomedical applications, microelectronics, and scientific research investigation. This research will extend the engineering application of advanced heat transfer and micro multiphase flow modeling techniques to further understand electrochemical discharge phenomenon.</AbstractNarration>
