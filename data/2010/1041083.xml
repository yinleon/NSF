    <AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will explore the properties of new photonic bandgap materials, called hyperuniform disordered solids, for novel isotropic photonic devices such as isolators and waveguides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The emphasis in this program will optimize computational tools to tailor this novel material for specific applications in photonic devices, manufacture and characterize sample materials displaying photonic band gap in all directions and polarizations, then fabricate waveguides with arbitrary bending angles and explore novel optical functionalities. The merit of this approach lies in the fundamentally novel devices and functionalities that can be obtained from this material, thus contributing to advancing the field of photonic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;Disordered materials with a complete photonic bandgap may open up a range of novel photonic functionalities, due to their advantageous properties, with applications in optical telecommunications, energy harvesting and non-linear optics. Laying the groundwork for the first photonic components may also unlock broader applications in electronics and phononics. This research will support a research scholar with early interest in this area, and research dissemination will be provided through publications in leading journals, international conferences and collaborative visits.&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the project has the potential to contribute to the understanding and development of a new material for next generation concepts for advanced photonic devices. Overall, the project will create new material and knowledge for teaching and instruction in Photonics.</AbstractNarration>
