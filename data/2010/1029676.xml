    <AbstractNarration>Net community production (NCP) and gross primary production (GPP) are two key processes in the marine carbon cycle which can be quantified in situ using triple oxygen isotopes (TOI) and continuous measurements of O2/Ar. Unfortunately, two key issues involved with measuring and interpreting TOI and O2/Ar data remain unresolved, namely, measurement uncertainty and spatial variability. A scientist from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution plans to carry out an intercalibration effort between eight laboratories worldwide to address whether differences in TOI signatures observed between sample sites are results of real differences in the oceanic isotopic signature of oxygen or whether they are measurement artifacts. As part of the intercalibration, a suite of gas, homogenized water, equilibrated water, and seawater samples will be distributed to the laboratories to assess each step of the measurement process. In addition, the researcher will participate in a cruise of opportunity to examine the spatial variability in TOI and O2/Ar ratios and to determine the causes for this variability. To accomplish this goal, several grid surveys of continuous surface ocean O2/Ar measurements from an equilibrator inlet mass spectrometer (EIMS) and high resolution TOI sampling will be conducted. A video plankton recorder (VPR-II) will be towed on the cruise to continuously measure profiles of O2, plankton and seston abundance, temperature, salinity, fluorescence, photosynthetically available radiation, and turbidity in the upper 150 m of the water column. Various statistical estimators (co-spectra, wavelets, probability density functions) will be used to investigate linkages between hydrographic properties, biogeochemical properties, O2/Ar ratios, and TOI. This work, which will be the first to combine an EIMS and the VPR-II, will quantify spatial variability on scales from two to one thousand kilometers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As regards broader Impacts, as a result of this intercalibration effort, tried and tested biogeochemical tracers for determining in situ gross primary productivity and net carbon productivity would be available to the marine sciences community. One graduate student would be supported and trained as part of this project.</AbstractNarration>
