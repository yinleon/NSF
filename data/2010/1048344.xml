    <AbstractNarration>PROJECT ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;?Counting Van Gogh and Vermeer? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automated thread counting algorithms, in development since 2007 by Professors Rick Johnson &lt;br/&gt;(Cornell University) and Don Johnson (Rice University), are poised for a profound impact on the &lt;br/&gt;practice of technical art history. This work is a pioneering effort in the emerging application of &lt;br/&gt;signal and image processing to the analysis of paintings. The approach is based on the utilization &lt;br/&gt;of spectral analysis of x-rays of paintings. X-rays can display the periodic intensity pattern due &lt;br/&gt;to the greater thickness of the lead white ground between the canvas threads. With the addition &lt;br/&gt;of innovative application-speci&amp;#64257;c signal processing, local peaks in the spectrum of the x-ray data &lt;br/&gt;can reveal the numbers of threads per centimeter, i.e. a thread count, separately for (nearly) ver- &lt;br/&gt;tically and (nearly) horizontally oriented threads. Such thread counts have been used previously, &lt;br/&gt;but their manual acquisition proved too costly to be done thoroughly. The introduction of the &lt;br/&gt;capability to assemble previously unthinkable thread density and angle pattern maps of high de- &lt;br/&gt;tail across the entire surface of a painting leads to correlation-based identi&amp;#64257;cation of canvases &lt;br/&gt;sharing the same pattern in thread density variations. Such weave maps and matches can now be &lt;br/&gt;assembled across all of the paintings on canvas of a single artist or school, thereby signi&amp;#64257;cantly &lt;br/&gt;extending the art historian?s capabilities in, for example, dating and attribution. &lt;br/&gt;The scale, breadth, and depth of such thread-counting projects represent a bold leap in the &lt;br/&gt;capabilities of technical art history. This grant supports the analysis phase of the &amp;#64257;rst projects &lt;br/&gt;of such grand scope: the thread counting and subsequent weave matching among (i) all of the &lt;br/&gt;paintings by Vincent van Gogh (for which data can be obtained by the end of 2010) and (ii) &lt;br/&gt;all of the paintings by the Delft School during the career of Johannes Vermeer (for which data &lt;br/&gt;can be obtained by the end of 2010). This grant places Professors Rick and Don Johnson in &lt;br/&gt;the center of the data fusion, data analysis and database creation activities that are scheduled &lt;br/&gt;to occur in Amsterdam during the spring of 2011. The archives being established of thread &lt;br/&gt;count reports, including weave density maps providing &amp;#64257;ngerprints for weave matching and angle &lt;br/&gt;maps for characterizing cusping, form a groundbreaking resource at a time when museums are &lt;br/&gt;just beginning to address the technological and cultural barriers to technical data sharing among &lt;br/&gt;museums and collaborating researchers outside the museum. This project is part of a long-term &lt;br/&gt;effort that aims to expand the utility of thread counting from x-rays to all suitable oil paintings on &lt;br/&gt;canvas, and to photos of unlined backs of old master paintings and of the raw canvas, for example, &lt;br/&gt;of the modern color&amp;#64257;eld painters and of densely-woven, multi-pattern fabrics prominent in the &lt;br/&gt;design and decorative arts.</AbstractNarration>
