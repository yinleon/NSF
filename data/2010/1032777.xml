    <AbstractNarration>The Society for In Vitro Biology (SIVB) provides a venue for scientific exchange, education and discussion on important topics related to the understanding and use of developmental processes of crop plants. The objective of the International Association for Plant Biotechnology (IAPB) is to promote plant biotechnology, including cell and tissue culture applications. Every four years (with the exception of meetings held outside the U.S.), SIVB and IAPB collaborate to convene a larger international conference focused on plant biotechnology. This year, the 2010 SIVB/IAPB conference will be held on June 6-11, 2010 in St. Louis (MO). This joint meeting will integrate topics from very basic research in plant biology to applied research related to the production of commercial products. The topics addressed in this program will describe up-to-date basic investigations into plant biology, and talks on applied aspects of genomics and metabolomics, as well as the effect of gene expression, biochemistry and physiology on plant developmental biology. Application of state-of-the-art technologies to practical solutions will be highlighted, including topics such as plant tolerance to stress, creation of biofuels from plants, and metabolic engineering for the production of pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals. The funding provided by NSF will broaden participation by defraying the costs of participation students, especially those from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
