    <AbstractNarration>The goals of the research are to develop an innovative exterior wall system capable of providing anti-terrorism protection and energy efficiency while maintaining cost effectiveness. The research will mesh the techniques used in the precast concrete sandwich wall industry with recent developments in construction materials and reinforcement strategies to create a non-proprietary protection system that can be readily incorporated into domestic and international building construction applications. The system will be capable of resisting pressure demands generated from intentional and unintentional explosions, near contact detonations, and ballistic demands while still maintaining architectural features and thermal efficiency. To accomplish these objectives analytical parametric studies and experimental validation will be conducted through a collaborative research program at Lehigh and Auburn Universities. The parametric studies will evaluate novel materials and reinforcement strategies using both nonlinear dynamic finite element analysis methods and simplified mechanics based approaches. The experimental studies include static, blast, and ballistic evaluations and will be used to validate the models and demonstrate the capability and limitations of the system developed. &lt;br/&gt;The research will advance the science of insulated concrete sandwich wall design allowing economically advantageous protection measures to be integrated into the buildings we live and work in. This will directly provide a societal benefit by creating a system that will enhance our national defense. The research will expand ongoing studies on cement based insulated wall systems conducted by engineering organizations and government laboratories allowing current collaborations to be continued and strengthened. Broad dissemination of the research will be accomplished through partnership and involvement of industry representatives from the tilt-up concrete and prestressed concrete markets and participation of research groups from the U.S. Army and Air Force. The program will provide advanced training to undergraduate and graduate students and industry participants through newly developed courses. Underrepresented groups will be recruited for participation in the project.</AbstractNarration>
