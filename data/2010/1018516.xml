    <AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks to answer a growing engineering need: the development of robust computationally efficient methods to analyze transient radiation and scattering from electrically large multiscale objects. The proposed work can be categorized into two interrelated areas: (i) building parallel transient potential evaluators for computing interactions between random non-uniform source/observer pairs wherein separation between two points ranges from a millionth to a thousand of the minimum wavelength; (ii) development of parallel time domain higher-order integral equation solvers that include these potential integrators. The four-fold objectives of this proposal are as follows: (i) rigorous methods that can be integrated with the plane wave time domain (PWTD) algorithm to extend its applicability to the quasi-static regime; (ii) windowed operators that will morph PWTD with beams; (iii) parallel, multiscale, fast potential evaluators that include the above developments; and (iv) integration of these into time domain integral equation solvers. To realize these objectives, advances will be made on two fronts: (i) numerical methods to effect these operations with a proper understanding of error bounds and the means to control them; and (ii) parallel algorithms that are provably scalable. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design and analysis of realistic devices is the holy grail of any computational endeavor. The same is true of Maxwell solvers. As Maxwell's equations form the foundation to a wide array of modern technology, methods developed to efficiently and accurately solve these equations can have wide ranging impact. To date, simulation tools have been complementary to, but have not supplanted experiments. The principal challenge has been bottlenecks posed by complex structural topologies with fine features, embedded in electrically large structures. Our goal-to enable the analysis of field deployable systems-will be realized by making advances in both the underlying numerics and parallel algorithms. These, in turn, will enable transition of this technology from tens of processors to thousands and tens of thousands of processors. Methods developed will yield a robust, accurate, and adaptable code that can be widely adopted in multiple domains in electromagnetics, acoustics, plasma dynamics, etc. To ensure dissemination, the PIs will work with practitioners in industry as well as with the Michigan Center for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. Existing channels in recruitment at MSU and ISU will be utilized to encourage participation by women and minorities. Undergraduate students will be involved through senior design projects and potentially through REU supplements. Additionally, a post-doctoral scholar will be mentored in all aspects necessary to be a successful academic.</AbstractNarration>
