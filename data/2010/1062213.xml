    <AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the University of Georgia that will provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 student participants, during for the summers of 2011- 2013. This 11-year old program, which began as a partnership between the University of Georgia and Clark Atlanta University, focuses on genomics, computational biology, and epigenetics -- and their integration in the new area of systems biology. There is a wide range of very interesting and exciting projects for the participants. Students are expected to do full-time lab research as well as participate in seminars and workshops, such as the responsible conduct of research, systems biology and molecular genetics research, career opportunities in industry and academia, and the graduate school application process. REU participants have access to a rich array of individual mentor's facilities as well as many interdepartmental laboratories and centers with core facilities for mass spectrometry, microarray analysis, massively parallel sequencing, nuclear magnetic resonance, etc. Visits to the Atlanta University Center of Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, and Spellman College as well as Fort Valley State University are made to encourage students from these institutions to apply. Students from other institutions, especially those from underrepresented groups and from institutions with limited opportunities for research, are also encouraged to apply. Participants are selected based on academic record, research interest, and potential for outstanding research in genomics, computational biology, and epigenetics. Student participants are tracked to determine their continued interest in their academic field of study, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. The program will be assessed by various means, including the REU common assessment tool. More information is available by visiting http://www.genetics.uga.edu/FGCB , or by contacting the PI (Dr. Jonathan Arnold at arnold@uga.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Meagher at meagher@uga.edu).</AbstractNarration>
