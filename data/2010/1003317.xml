    <AbstractNarration>The Community College of Baltimore County, in partnership with the University of Maryland, Baltimore County plans to implement a comprehensive strategy to offer supplemental technology training for teachers in Project Lead the Way (PLTW) schools. The PLTW training approach offers pre-engineering coursework for middle and high school teachers to deliver an activity-based, project-based, and problem-based learning (APPB) curriculum. Content includes authentic experiences in engineering, biomechanics, aeronautics and related subjects. The ATE PLTW Professional Development project is designed to supplement the current Core Training for middle and high school teachers in seven states (MD, NY, OH, CA, SC, IN, TX, WI). Three Master Teachers and/or Professors and one Coordinator from seven PLTW affiliate universities will be trained to provide two one-day professional development workshops for teachers in their region. The affiliate universities include Rochester Institute of Technology, Sinclair Community College, San Diego State University, University of South Carolina, Purdue University, University of Texas at Tyler, and Milwaukee School of Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The professional development includes Fischertechniks, Revit, MD Solids and Autodesk Inventor software and applications systems. Project deliverables include a train-the-trainer implementation model, PLTW training at seven affiliate universities, revision of the trainer and PD curricula, and dissemination of the model nationally in conjunction with PLTW headquarters. A variety of methodologies will be used to evaluate the project's impact on student learning, teacher competence and confidence in teaching PLTW, the training curriculum and accompanying Fischertechniks manual, and the most effective approach for implementing the PLTW training model. The comprehensive evaluation plan also addresses the compliance of professional development with industry needs and standards and dissemination processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By expanding the training on a national level using a train-the-trainer approach, this project may have considerable impact on pre-engineering education and has the potential to reach students currently underrepresented in engineering education programs. The popularity of PLTW nationally ensures that an enthusiastic pool of educators is available to participate in the training. It is anticipated that over the life of the project, 80 middle and high school teachers per year will be trained by each affiliate university, resulting in an overall impact of 1,433 teachers and 36,000 students.</AbstractNarration>
