    <AbstractNarration>"CoLang," the Institute for Collaborative Language Research, will be held at the University of Kansas in June-July, 2012. The Institute provides an opportunity for graduate students, practicing linguists, and community linguists to become trained in community-centered language documentation. Two earlier Institutes, formerly called InField, were held in 2008 at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and in 2010 at the University of Oregon. The six-week Institute consists of two parts: the WorkÂ­shops, which consist of two weeks of intensive workshops on the practice of documentary linguistics, followed by a Practicum, a four-week apprenticeship in the application of linguistic science and technology to on-site empirical documentation (a.k.a. "field linguistics"). The Workshops offer team-taught, state-of-the-art training in linguistic theory and discovery, technology, community language work, and applied linguistics. The Practicum allows students to implement all of these skills by working with speakers of understudied languages. Three or four language Practicums will be offered in 2012.</AbstractNarration>
