    <AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of terahertz graphene electronics requires a variety of fundamental questions to be addressed. This project will use epitaxial graphene on SiC as an unprecedented platform to answer these questions. The work is broken into three parts. In the first set of experiments, the very first studies of growth kinetics in a high-pressure furnace environment using x-ray scattering will be carried out and lead to a better understanding of graphene growth. In the second part of the research, the patternabilty of epitaxial graphene will be exploited to grow large area arrays of graphene nano-ribbons. These arrays will allow, for the first time, photoemission studies of the width dependent gap. Finally, the ribbon arrays will allow various adsorbents to be side diffused into the graphene-SiC interface. This work will allow controlled experiments on compensation doping of graphene ribbons to overcome charge transfer from the SiC. Graduate and undergraduate students will not only learn a variety of highly specialized experimental techniques, but they will also have the opportunity to become forefront researchers in graphene electronics development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The competitive advantage of the US electronics industry requires a solution for the approaching end of silicon-based electronics. Epitaxial graphene offers a serious promise to drastically surpass silicon and lead to ultra high-speed electronics. While epitaxial graphene is a radical electronics material, it requires novel device designs, growth methods and materials challenges to be understood and tested before graphene enters commercial or military systems. The research carried out under this program addresses these challenges. The very first studies to understand graphene growth in a high-pressure furnace environment will be carried out. Research will involve new techniques to produce ultra thin graphene ribbons that will allow studies of this new material's unique electronic properties. Graduate and undergraduate students participating in this research will not only learn a variety of highly specialized experimental techniques, but they will also have the opportunity to become forefront researchers in graphene electronics development. This highly trained workforce will allow the US to continue its lead in the Global electronics industry.</AbstractNarration>
