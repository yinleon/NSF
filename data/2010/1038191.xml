    <AbstractNarration>The investigators plan to design, develop and deploy 11 prototypes each measuring CO2, CO, NO2, O3, temperature and relative humidity. The ultimate target is to develop these prototypes into a novel instrument that will be a dense, nested grid of approximately 300 nodes. This initial investigation will focus on calibration and design, laying the groundwork for the larger purchase and deployment to follow. This idea has the potential to change the paradigm of environmental science, from one in which high quality measurements are made at a small number of locations for short periods of time, to one in which data are available at much more directly useful spatial resolution and temporal extent. The prototype instrument will be the core element of a large reliable network with detailed coverage over an approximately 800 km2 region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument setup will serve as the core research project for at least one Berkeley graduate student who will receive an unusually broad interdisciplinary education at the interface of atmospheric chemistry, atmospheric dynamics and engineering. In addition, this instrument will be an available tool for teaching at all educational levels. For example, to the extent possible sensors will be located at participating elementary schools and science museums and will make the observations available in formats useful for the research community and for educational materials in schools and museums.</AbstractNarration>
