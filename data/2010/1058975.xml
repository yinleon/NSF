    <AbstractNarration>The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has made it imperative to understand the effects of crude oil exposure on marine life. This RAPID project is designed to investigate the effects of crude oil compounds on the development of fish larvae. Embryonic stages of animal development are very sensitive to environmental pollutants like those in crude oil. Fish larvae form an important component of the Gulf Coast food web, and one goal of this project is to determine how exposure to these compounds will induce developmental abnormalities that may result in severe impairment of surviving fish. The RAPID response is particularly appropriate, as the both the brood fish and their spawn have been acutely exposed to crude oil. Understanding the molecular and genetic basis of the effects of any abnormalities will help determine whether they result from molecular pathways common to other environmental pollutants or are unique to crude oil. This will be investigated using both state-of-the-art DNA sequencing gene expression technologies and bioinformatics-based gene network analysis. The implementation of these methods to study the molecular basis of the effects of crude oil exposure on embryonic development represents a major step forward in the use of technologically-advanced gene analysis tools to understand the molecular basis of interactions between organisms and their environment. This project provides training for graduate students in molecular and environmental science and the opportunity for research scientists to communicate findings to the public that concern the livelihood and welfare of American citizens.</AbstractNarration>
