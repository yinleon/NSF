    <AbstractNarration>Scientific Goals &lt;br/&gt; All organisms are faced with challenges (such as predators or storms) from the environment. Animals mount a stress response in order to survive these challenges, but even after nearly 100 years of studying stress, there is only a basic understanding of how the stress response helps wild animals to survive. This lack of knowledge is of growing significance because man-made noxious events (such as habitat degradation or human disturbance) could cause chronic stress. Although a short-term stress response to a predator or storm is necessary for survival, chronic stress can be very harmful, and if it affects enough individuals, can cause population declines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project will use wild European starlings as a model to test two hypotheses: (1) That increased frequency of normal environmental events can result in chronic stress in wild animals; and (2) There will be long-term impacts on offspring whose mothers were exposed to chronic stress. Testing these hypotheses will require an integrated approach of laboratory and field studies on the physiology and behavior of both captive and free-living starlings. The ultimate goal is to create a physiological and endocrinological profile of chronically stressed wild animals. This will provide criteria for identifying chronically stressed individuals in the wild and determining the long-term impact on those individuals and their offspring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;Student participation will be vital to accomplishment of the research goals. Graduate students, undergraduate students, and a postdoctoral fellow will receive important training in how to trap animals, take samples, perform assays, write manuscripts, and other important laboratory and field skills. Conservation missions could benefit from additional information to determine whether animals are chronically stressed in the wild.</AbstractNarration>
