    <AbstractNarration>The project is creating modules in sustainable bio-plastics to introduce natural non-petroleum based polymer materials into several engineering and material science curricula. The modules contain lectures, demonstration experiments, hands-on laboratories, and a design project in an effort to increase student engagement and their interest in sustainable bio-based materials. The modules present basic principles of polymer science and engineering and new trends in bio-based polymers thus providing students with a better understanding of the theory and applications of sustainable green plastics, improved problem-solving and critical thinking skills; and motivation and tools needed to incorporate sustainable materials in their professional decisions. The material, which is available on the widely accessed nanohub website, is being used at Northeastern University, Lehigh University, and the Georgia Institute of Technology and is being disseminated through faculty workshops, conference presentations, journal publications, and industrial short-courses. The project is being evaluated by an outside consultant to monitor the impact on students and faculty at each site using student and instructor surveys and focus groups. Broader impacts include wide dissemination, especially though the faculty workshops, postings on the nanohub website, and the industrial outreach.</AbstractNarration>
