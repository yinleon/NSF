    <AbstractNarration>Software Engineering research is one of the enablers in societal grand challenges such as Health Care, and Software Engineering researchers need to be involved to attain long-term workable solutions. For example, current efforts to make health data available electronically on a national scale could benefit from research in software architectures and software engineering economics to avoid locking into systems with inherently limited capabilities and evolvability. This project will conduct a case study of health record systems, in collaboration with the School of Medicine, leading to architectural specifications that will be the basis for prototypes and a test bed for interoperable Health Care applications. This will enable software researchers to understand the costs and risks of architectural design decisions in building the Health Care systems of the future. Demonstrations and evaluation will be built on the Eclipse-based IBM Jazz platform. The project will explore what role that the large body of Software Engineering research can play in this societal grand challenge.</AbstractNarration>
