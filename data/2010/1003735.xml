    <AbstractNarration>The project is developing a Sustainable Energy Education Delivery System (SEEDS) mobile lab--an alternative energy learning laboratory powered exclusively by solar, wind and biofuel. SEEDS is designed to educate and excite students, teachers and industry personnel about alternative and renewable energy (ARE) as well as energy efficiency and conservation. SEEDS is a self contained ARE classroom laboratory used in the Crowder College (CC) nine-county service region to train area high school students, community college students, secondary and postsecondary faculty members, as well as provide regional business and industry employee training. On high school campuses, students gain exposure to a field often discussed, but rarely available for hands-on learning. Teacher training on school campuses has real impact and is cost effective. CC students make use of the laboratory when it is not on tour. The ability to offer flexibility to existing articulation agreements strengthens partnerships with four year institutions such as the University of Missouri. Through hands-on activities made possible with training equipment and simulation software, participants have a visible and measureable experience with the ARE sources. An innovative data acquisition (DAQ) system provides students with a grasp of energy production loads and storage systems. Energy consumption of familiar devices such as a computer/monitor system, lighting, HDTV and a video game system is monitored; as well as the energy production from the ARE sources and the battery storage system. A metered stationary bike and hand-crank generator bring power and energy concepts full-circle by relating the amount of mechanical effort required to produce varying amounts of energy.</AbstractNarration>
