    <AbstractNarration>This international symposium will bring together leading mathematicians to discuss the latest work and developments in geometry, topology and related &amp;#64257;elds. The distinguished invited speakers at this conference will speak about the current edge of our knowledge and highlight the areas that are likely to lead to future progress. The conference makes it possible for the community of geometers and topologists from the region and around the country to learn the most recent developments, to meet with each other and to share mathematics. Since the topics cover a wide range from geometry, topology, algebra, and mathematical physics, we expect a great deal of interchange of ideas during the symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium will provide a rich environment in which US graduate students and recent Ph.D.?s can learn about new and important developments in geometry and topology. Participation by women and minorities will be actively sought and encouraged. An important component of the conference is to attract and help graduate students, recent Ph.Ds, and members of underrepresented groups to come from all over the country and other parts of the world to learn and interact with the leaders of the &amp;#64257;elds featured during this conference.&lt;br/&gt;A special poster session will be held to allow participants, especially young mathematicians, to present their work and to interact with senior researchers.</AbstractNarration>
