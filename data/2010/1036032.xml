    <AbstractNarration>The University of California, Santa Cruz is awarded a grant to enhance marine research and safety infrastructure at the Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve (Big Creek). Big Creek is one of only four University of California Natural Reserves that provide access to sub-tidal research, and is the only UC Natural Reserve that is situated within a completely protected watershed with a perennial creek that flows into a marine protected area. Marine facilities will be upgraded through the provision of a vessel and other critical diving and marine safety equipment. Enhanced marine infrastructure will provide support for research and education by upgrading diving facilities, essential equipment, and broadening marine access and safety measures. The equipment will be used to facilitate ongoing marine research and education programs. In recent years, the reserve has facilitated marine studies on a variety of sub-tidal research projects and supports ongoing training of scientific divers. These activities have increased our knowledge of the kelp forest ecosystems, basic biology, and trained students in sub-tidal research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Big Creek provides one of the only sub-tidal access points for vessels along the rugged Big Sur coast and is an important field station for this remote area of Coastal California. Marine researchers use Big Creek because of it's access to a wide spectrum of marine environments, diverse populations of marine organisms, and near-shore kelp forests. Increasing equipment and safety measures at Big Creek will provide critical support for sub-tidal and marine research. These improvements will augment and enhance marine teaching and research opportunities at Big Creek as well as provide a stronger incentive for collaborative studies focused on questions examining the marine/terrestrial interface. Big Creek Reserve advances science through supporting research and provides an undergraduate and graduate outdoor classroom for teaching and training students. Although remote, Big Creek (because of research facilities, equipment, and access to protected habitats) supports a diverse user base and fulfills an important niche for supporting scientific studies along the Big Sur Coast of Central California.</AbstractNarration>
