    <AbstractNarration>Technical: This project aims for identification and greater understanding of the exciton diffusion mechanism in organic photovoltaic materials. The project approach seeks to correlate investigations of exciton diffusion carried out using steady-state and ultrafast spectroscopies as well as device based results. These studies are expected to be able to identify the most promising and accurate means of characterizing exciton diffusion, and to also elucidate the role of molecular structure and singlet-triplet exciton intersystem crossing on the diffusing species and mechanism. The latter will assist in clarification of the potential role phosphorescent materials can play in OPVs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance in electronics and photonics--the basic scientific findings of the project are expected to assist significantly with the development of alternative energy sources. Additionally, the PIs have made a priority of the education of elementary, high school, undergraduate and graduate students on issues relating to energy, and the role materials can play in renewable energy systems. Multiple programs will be undertaken including educational outreach for school children in the 3rd through 12th grades, summer research experience for high school students, research opportunities for undergraduate students through programs including the University of Minnesota (UMN) Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) and MRSEC REU programs, as well as the integration of research results into undergraduate and graduate classes in Chemical Engineering and Materials Science and Chemistry will be undertaken. The PIs will also disseminate results of the proposed work to industry through the UMN Industrial Partnership for Research in Interfacial and Materials Engineering (IPrime), which provides opportunities for professionals in industry to collaborate with researchers at the UMN. The PIs typically help co-organize and participate in the IPrime annual meeting, which offers students the opportunity to present their research to member companies. The project research and education activities represent an important contribution to the education of students and the wider community both at and beyond the UMN.</AbstractNarration>
