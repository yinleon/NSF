    <AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract: In this project we will use techniques developed in our lab, and by others, based on atomic-force microscopy (AFM) to probe local dielectric and mechanical fluctuations and responses on nanometer length scales. These will be applied to several materials with the objective of investigating the fundamental physics of the glass transition, non-equilibrium statistical physics, and nanophysics of materials. The proposed work will include the following three main components: (a) Nanoscale spatio-temporal dynamics will be studied in glassy materials in a search for growing dynamical correlation length scales, which play a dominant role in leading glass transition theories; (b) Measurement of both fluctuations and responses will allow us to test the validity of the global and local fluctuation-dissipation-relation (FDR) in equilibrium and out-of equilibrium in various materials; and (c) Nanodielectric spectroscopy will be used to study near-surface polymer dynamics in polymers and polymer blends. This international collaboration, will exchange U.S. undergraduate international co-op students and other researchers with the DIPC in Spain. They will receive invaluable international experience and training in nanosciences. Development of a reliable method for nanodielectric spectroscopy in particular would have a broad impact on the field of polymer materials science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Abstract: In the coming years, our economy will depend heavily on high-tech innovations, particularly in nanotechnology, information technology, and renewable energy. International cooperation may be beneficial in many cases. Both solar and fuel-cell technologies rely strongly on advanced, nanostructured polymeric materials. Such industries are have an increasing need to understand and predict material properties on nanometer length scales (a row of 5 to 10 atoms). Researchers are increasingly aware of the importance of variations of material properties with position or time, on the nanoscale. Advances in our ability to explore local properties in these materials makes it possible to gain a deeper understanding and better control of these properties and the physics of complex materials. In this project new nanodielectric imaging and spectroscopy techniques will be used to probe property variations in nano-structured materials such as polymer blends. This project will exchange U.S. undergraduate international co-op students and other researchers with a Spanish lab in order to facilitate collaborative projects and to exchange information, materials and skills between the labs. Students will receive invaluable international experience and training in nano-sciences. Development of a reliable method for nanodielectric spectroscopy in particular would have a broad impact on the field of polymer materials science.</AbstractNarration>
