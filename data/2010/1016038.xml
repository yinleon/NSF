    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research focuses on metamorphosis for shape analysis, which relies on a shape transformation&lt;br/&gt;model within which shape variation is coupled with other transformations of the data, permitting&lt;br/&gt;topological changes, or partial advection of attributes attached to the deformed objects. This results&lt;br/&gt;in a versatile framework in which many different models can be devised, based on any mathematical&lt;br/&gt;structure that can both be advected by diffeomorphisms and embedded in a Hilbert or&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian space. This construction equips the space of deformable objects of interest with a new&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian metric, allowing for the comparison of these objects, and for the use of tools associated&lt;br/&gt;to data analysis in Riemannian manifolds, like the representation of data sets in exponential&lt;br/&gt;charts. The research will involve models of metamorphosis in which the deformable structures are represented&lt;br/&gt;by images, densities, or measures, in two or three dimensions. One of the main issues in&lt;br/&gt;this context is the computation of geodesics, either as a variational problem (shortest path between&lt;br/&gt;two points in the manifold) or as an initial value problem (solving the Euler-Lagrange equation for&lt;br/&gt;the evolution of geodesics). The numerical analysis of both problems is challenging, especially&lt;br/&gt;when one adds the requirement for the two solutions to be numerically consistent, in the sense that&lt;br/&gt;discrete solutions of the first problem coincide with discrete solutions of the second one, which is&lt;br/&gt;important for applications. This research will address these issues, by developing variational&lt;br/&gt;integrators for the initial value problems, and shooting methods for the boundary value&lt;br/&gt;problems, in contexts that will involve solutions that combine smooth and singular components.&lt;br/&gt;The PI and collaborators will also deploy and extend of a comprehensive software&lt;br/&gt;that provides a collection of algorithms associated to diffeomorphic matching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of shape analysis is to understand and represent variations of shapes in data sets of&lt;br/&gt;deformable objects (like collections of landmarks, images, curves or surfaces). This issue is important,&lt;br/&gt;in particular, for the characterization of anatomical variations in medical images, and of&lt;br/&gt;their relation with pathologies. One of the main areas of applications in this context is known as&lt;br/&gt;Computational Anatomy, and methods from mathematical shape analysis have already been used for &lt;br/&gt;several successful applications. Examples of developments in this domain include collaborations of the PI with&lt;br/&gt;researchers at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, or at the Institute for Computational Medicine at &lt;br/&gt;Johns Hopkins University, on the analysis of brain disease and of cardiac failure. &lt;br/&gt;The theory and tools that will be developed in this research will enable the analysis of situations that cannot be &lt;br/&gt;handled by previous methods, which work under the assumption that anatomical variation can be essentially described&lt;br/&gt;by smooth changes of shape. The proposed approach, called metamorphosis, will be able to address cases&lt;br/&gt;for which these assumptions are not satisfied, and make possible, for example, the analysis of images&lt;br/&gt;that include dramatic changes between subjects. This includes the analysis of datasets measuring the evolution&lt;br/&gt;of tumors, or describing brain recovery after a major stroke. The research will contribute to the emergence of new solutions&lt;br/&gt;in such contexts, and make the related software available to the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
