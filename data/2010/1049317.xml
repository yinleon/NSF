    <AbstractNarration>The University of Massachusetts Lowell is conducting 1.5-day conference in the fall of 2011, tentatively titled "Learning on the Go: Using Out-of-Home Media to Communicate Climate Science." The conference, to be held at the Lowell Inn and Conference Center, will bring together approximately 125 professionals and students in climate science, communications, out-of-home media, social science, informal and formal science education, and educational psychology with the goal of exploring opportunities for applying out-of-home media to communicating science to the public, with a particular emphasis on climate change science. "Out-of-home media" is defined as any type of communication that reaches individuals while they are out of the home, including mobile media, billboards, mass transit placards, posters, etc. The intent is to consider how informal science education and its impacts on learning can be expanded via the adaptation of such media to the goals of ISE. Conference proceedings and podcasts of keynote sessions will be made available on a conference Web site. Conference evaluation will be conducted by Arbor Consulting Partners.</AbstractNarration>
