    <AbstractNarration>The PI's request funding to develop a submersible system capable of in situ 222Rn analysis while deployed from a remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) or autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Such a system would allow researchers to conduct high-resolution radon surveying through 3-D grids of bottom water and later return to sites of interest to measure a 222Rn time-series in order to quantify SGD fluxes. The system design relies on a new technique to sparge radon, while submerged, from the water for analysis via bubbling a closed air loop through a contained water column. Preliminary evidence shows this to be a viable approach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is quickly gaining recognition as an important delivery mechanism of new and recycled nutrients to the coastal ocean. Chemical tracers such as 222Rn and radium isotopes offer excellent utility at detecting groundwater discharge zones and quantifying associated fluxes in nearshore (shallow) waters, but the traditional approaches to sampling and measuring these tracers become progressively less useful as the water column deepens, stratification strengthens, and physical mixing becomes more complex. In deeper waters (1) of the continental shelf where outcropping geological units can focus SGD, and (2) around critical habitats like coral reef ecosystems, one?s ability to measure these tracers is limited to grab sampling-scale resolution. Such resolution is generally not sufficient to understand the pathways, driving forces, and rates of these discharges, nor is it conducive to quantifying associated nutrient delivery fluxes. Prior to assessing the global significance of SGD, then, there exists great need for a tool capable of in situ, continuous measurement of geochemical tracers of SGD in deeper waters of the continental shelf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since this proposed study develops a new research tool available for other scientists, the success of this study will have a large and broad impact on SGD studies in important deep basins, hydrothermal studies quantifying hydrothermal flow, and deep-water circulation and mixing studies using Rn-222 as a tracer. The investigators have included a plan for outreach to sponsor a two-semester, senior Design Clinic team of 3-4 undergraduate female engineering students from Smith College's Picker Engineering Program. This undergraduate team will gain experience working on a real-world engineering problem and this project will likewise benefit from their engineering contribution. Breier has undertaken a similar collaboration with Smith College for the NDSF microbial mat sampler project and the results to both sides have been outstanding. Breier and Singh will also mentor a MIT/WHOI Joint Program Ph.D. student as part of this project, with the hope that one of the Smith College engineering students may make this transition. Peterson will also serve as an undergraduate mentor.</AbstractNarration>
