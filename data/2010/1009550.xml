    <AbstractNarration>MASSCLEAN: A powerful new tool for the study of stellar clusters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Massive stellar clusters delineate spiral arms and map the star formation history of our Galaxy. This research program uses a novel approach to locate and characterize massive open star clusters of the Milky Way, the Local Group and external galaxies using image simulations. This work will use optical and (primarily) infrared observations and the newly created image analysis tool, MASSCLEAN, which stands for "Massive Cluster Evolution and Analysis package". &lt;br/&gt;This distinct approach will make significant advances in stellar cluster analysis and lead to better constrained cluster characteristics in both resolved and unresolved systems. The improved knowledge of stellar clusters in the Milky Way from this program will allows us to better estimate poorly constrained values, such as the high-mass cluster mass function and open cluster lifetimes. Improved values for the Milky Way will lead to more meaningful comparisons to similar values derived for other galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator (PI) is part of the team of the "Vista Variables in the Via Lactea"(VVV) infrared survey team. Observations with VISTA (the 4-m Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy in N. Chile) are expected to give the newest, deepest, and highest resolution near-infrared images of the inner Milky Way to locate new massive clusters. These optically obscured objects make up a significant, yet currently under-explored, structural component of our Milky Way. The PI and her collaborators will use optimized search algorithms and more accurate cluster characterization, using combined spectroscopic and image analysis techniques to uncover the massive cluster population of our Milky Way. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studying massive star clusters in the Milky Way provides resolvable analogues to calibrate the integrated light of unresolved extra-galactic massive star clusters. MASSCLEAN will also provide improved models for integrated photometry of stellar clusters, allowing researchers to derive more accurate ages and masses of extragalactic star clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major component of this research program is the open access and support of the stellar cluster image analysis tool, MASSCLEAN. During the grant period, the PI's group will produce a searchable database of 100s of millions of stellar cluster models to provide age and mass estimates for unresolved, extragalactic stellar clusters via the cluster's integrated photometric properties and using a chi-squared minimization routine. The PI is deeply involved in a number of large-scale initiatives at all levels of education (particularly grade school and undergraduate education) aimed at increasing the representation of women in science.</AbstractNarration>
