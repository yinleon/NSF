    <AbstractNarration>1034242&lt;br/&gt;Qu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This investigation involves flow boiling of non-azeotropic and azeotropic binary mixtures in two types of micro-scale heat transfer enhancement structures, namely micro-channels and micro-pin fin arrays. Forced convection boiling of binary mixtures in channels of conventional size, as well as flow boiling of pure fluids in micro-scale structures has been studied extensively. However, forced convection boiling of binary mixtures in micro-scale structures remains largely unexplored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: An experimental approach will be taken to investigate and quantify heat transfer rates, two-phase pressure drops, critical heat fluxes, and flow instabilities in situations involving forced convection boiling of binary mixtures in small channels. The influence of mixture composition and microstructure geometry on the boiling process will be explored, and accurate modeling tools will be developed. Possible heat transfer degradation associated with forced convection boiling of mixtures in micro-scale structures will be examined and the mechanisms leading to degradation will be identified. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The research will impact a number of technologies, including but not limited to use of miniaturized heat sinks for high-heat-flux cooling applications, as well as the design of miniature chemical reactors. The project will expose graduate, undergraduate, and high school students to micro-scale flow boiling transport processes through integrated teaching, research, and outreach activities. Existing institutional programs that target involvement of underrepresented groups will also be utilized.</AbstractNarration>
