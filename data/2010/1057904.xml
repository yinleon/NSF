    <AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division supports the research group of Professor Jonathan Sessler of the University of Texas at Austin on a project that involves the chemistry of expanded porphyrins and related heterocyclic macrocycles. Particular emphasis will be placed on new, electron deficient macrocycles whose electronics are "reversed" compared to those of most expanded porphyrins. These new systems are expected to display interesting molecular recognition properties and act as building blocks for the construction of higher order supramolecular assemblies. This will permit the construction of self-assembled organometallic frameworks, supramolecular organic frameworks, threaded pseudorotaxanes, and self-assembled electron transfer ensembles, among other possibilities. The new molecular and supramolecular materials prepared in the context of this project are expected to be environmentally responsive and to respond to more than one analyte. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is likely that new chemical entities with broad utility will emerge from this program and be explored by commercial entities. Work in this area contributes to the development of the nation's technological infrastructure. Work in the synthetic porphyrin analogue area is highly interdisciplinary. It involves aspects of organic synthesis, inorganic chemistry, spectroscopy, materials science, catalysis, and supramolecular chemistry. It provides excellent training for young researchers who are then able to work in a variety of settings, including academe, industry, and government. The collaborations with other research groups contribute to the broader impact of the work and provide educational opportunities for the students involved in the project. Collaborative research experience with overseas collaborators is highly beneficial and is contributing to the development of a stronger, scientifically and culturally literate human resource base in the U.S.</AbstractNarration>
