    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop nanoparticle-based lubricant additives to enhance Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL) in high-energy grinding. Nanoparticle-based lubricant additives for specific applications will first be synthesized. Then a special system to deliver tribofilms at the tool-workpiece interfaces for selective lubrication will be developed. This technology is expected to significantly reduce friction and heat generation at the machining interface, resulting in excellent surface finish and reduced thermo-mechanical damage while maintaining surface integrity of machined parts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide nanoparticle-based lubricant additives and a delivery system for reduced cost, improved quality, and increased energy saving in a broad range of aggressive machining applications. This technology will also facilitate the replacement of re-circulating lubricant systems, which are sources of variation and significant waste streams.</AbstractNarration>
