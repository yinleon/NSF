    <AbstractNarration>Fayetteville State University seeks to develop the comprehensive Integrated STEM Academic Success (ISAS) project. In agreement with the institution's strategic priorities, ISAS seeks to increase retention and graduation rates of STEM undergraduates,and prepare leaders who can compete successfully in the global economy and demonstrate 21st century global competencies. The goals and objectives of the ISAS project are to: (a) increase the number of students receiving degrees in STEM disciplines by improving retention and graduation rates; (b) increase the student enrollment in STEM disciplines; and (c) improve the quality of faculty in STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;ISAS program activities provide opportunities to advance knowledge and understanding relative to effective and innovative approaches to support recruitment and retention for undergraduate students in the STEM disciplines as well as placement for recent graduates in STEM enterprises. The use of and the evaluation of intrusive academic advisement and mentoring models, undergraduate research, learning communities, comprehensive tracking, accelerated courses, faculty development, summer bridge programs and research mentoring will establish a clear relationship between education and research. Successful implementation of the ISAS program activities holds the potential for addressing and resolving the issues of enrollment, retention, persistence and graduation in STEM academic programs. ISAS will equip graduates with skills necessary to enter a competitive and global STEM workforce or graduate school.</AbstractNarration>
