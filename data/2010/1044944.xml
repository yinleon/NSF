    <AbstractNarration>This is a one year Research Training Group (RTG) type of project in Analysis and Differential Equations at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Chicago. The project funds graduate students and visitors and the organization of a summer course aimed towards advanced undergraduates, graduate students and young postdocs in mathematics, engineering and sciences. Analysis and differential equations are central, deep and rich fields of mathematics. From an applied perspective, differential equations are the most fundamental mathematical models in all of science and engineering. They describe phenomena from quantum mechanics to weather prediction and climate and are the basic theoretical tools in science and technology. The exponential improvement in the capabilities of modern computers allows for the practical use of increasingly complex systems of differential equations. Although recent results have solved numerous outstanding problems, many still remain open. The understanding of the mathematical properties of these models is essential. The need in both academia and industry for young, well-trained mathematicians in these areas is ever growing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs along with others in the mathematical community believe that there is a severe shortage of US PhDs trained in (applied) analysis and differential equations. The goal of the proposed one year project is to provide the seed towards developing a well-rounded and modern educational program to increase the number of American researchers working in the applied analysis and differential equations and to improve the quality of the training of future mathematical scientists (working in either academia or industry). Having support for graduate students working in this general area will increase the number of students willing to work in applied analysis. The expectation is that the proposed summer course will serve as a model of the type of educational activity needed to attract more researchers to differential equations as well as to educate student and postdocs in engineering and sciences.</AbstractNarration>
