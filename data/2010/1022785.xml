    <AbstractNarration>This project develops and promotes the use of a cyber-enabled infrastructure, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) Concept Warehouse, that could be used throughout the core chemical engineering curriculum (Material and Energy Balances, Thermodynamics, Transport Phenomena, Kinetics and Reactor Design, and Materials Science). The goal is to create a community of learning focused on concept-based instruction, within the discipline of chemical engineering. Conceptual questions, both as Concept Inventories and Concept Tests, will be available through an interactive website maintained through the Education Division of the AIChE, the discipline's major professional society. It uses a flexible, query-driven information storage system so that conceptual learning can be deployed by programs and instructors as it best fits into their curriculum and culture. The overall objective is to lower the barrier for using concept-based instruction and assessment so that more chemical engineering faculty incorporate concept-based learning into their classes. Workshops will be offered to faculty and department administrators to explain the value and methods of concept-based instruction.</AbstractNarration>
