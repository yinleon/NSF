    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is to support a workshop on Applications of Computer Vision in Archaeology. The workshop will bring together about 100 archaeologists, cultural heritage preservationists, computer vision, visualization, graphics, and new media research and practitioners to discuss the state-of-the art in current research. The event will also provide a forum for planning and coordination of future efforts. Since the first workshop on Applications of Computer Vision in Archaeology was held in June 2003 the domain of research interest has broadened significantly to include research in graphics and visualization. At present, nearly all phases of archaeological practice, from discovery in the field, through artifact analysis and conservation, to the presentation of new findings to the public are in a period of radical change. Computer vision research combined with graphics, visualization and computational methods have made available to archaeology and other interdisciplinary research dealing visual artifacts a rich set of tools and methods to extend research capabilities. New efforts range from the creation of virtual libraries (digital publishing of field records) to computer-assisted artifact mending technologies to 3D presentations of historical site interpretations.</AbstractNarration>
