    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a U.S.-Japan workshop on Scientific Collaboration and Productivity in Tokyo in March 2010, jointly organized with collaborators at Hitotsubashi University, Seijyo University, and Japan?s National Institute of Science &amp; Technology Policy (NISTEP). There is a strong need to understand research teams in a global context and for major research centers such as the U.S. and Japan to learn from the experiences in the other country in order to develop best practices for guiding scientific collaboration. The need is fueled by three facts: (1) scientific research is becoming increasingly collaborative; (2) there is an increased interest in translational research; and (3) there is increased emphasis on the part of policy makers to expand the scientific and technical labor force, and, in particular, to increase the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in research. The workshop will to examine three themes: the composition of scientific teams, especially by gender and seniority; collaboration structures, including size, disciplines and institutions; and impact of the structure and composition of collaboration on scientific and commercial outcomes of research. It also aims to help set an agenda for future research on the nature of collaboration, including a joint survey of US and Japanese scientists. The award supports travel support for U.S. participants, including economists and sociologists of science at the junior and senior level. The award is cofunded by the Science of Science &amp; Innovation Program in the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences directorate.</AbstractNarration>
