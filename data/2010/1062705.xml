    <AbstractNarration>This three year REU Site program at the University of Alabama,Tuscaloosa is focused on developing technologies for more environmentally-benign energy. The main proposition is that innovative science and engineering solutions are needed to provide environmentally-sustainable energy for domestic consumption. Globally, power consumption is currently 14 TW, and it is expected to triple within 40 years, as third-world economies continue to expand. In order to engage and train the next generation of scientists and engineers in providing clean energy solutions, this REU Site is built around a set of projects that address various technical aspects of future energy solutions. These projects include: technologies for oil spill cleanup; ionic liquids for CO2 separation and capture; CO2 emissions monitoring from sequestration formations; fuel cell, supercapacitor, and electrochemistry modeling; biogas and biodiesel production; energy storage in clathrate hydrates; and environmental catalysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clean energy solutions are needed to sustain our nation's economic development and environmental prosperity. Thus, our nation's future depends upon creative solutions, robust engineering designs, and implementation on large scales, and these activities must be supported by a rich pipeline of young engineers. The recent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico highlights the reality of our clean energy challenge, but at the same time, it provides a unique opportunity for learning and student engagement. These projects provide excellent opportunities for conducting hypothesis-driven research, using state-of-the-art facilities. Through these activities, the students will acquire the knowledge and hands-on training to develop clean energy technologies, preparing the students for long-term career opportunities. The recruitment plan is broad, but there are several aspects that should help to recruit underrepresented students to participate in these clean&lt;br/&gt;energy research projects. The PIs have established strong connections with several HBCU institutions through their participation in the NSF-funded workshop: "Introducing HBCU Faculty to Material Science and Engineering". Several of these HBCU faculty have already committed to help recruit students from their institutions into this REU program. Overall, this REU Site program will recruit and train a diverse group of engineers, expose them to the tangential aspects of clean energy solutions, and prepare them for a wide array of future research opportunities.</AbstractNarration>
