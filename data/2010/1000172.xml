    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to use modeling and simulation methods to understand the fundamental deformation and failure mechanisms of asphalt concrete, which will lead to designing better performing mixes of balanced capability against rutting, fatigue and thermal cracking; and integration of mix design into pavement structure design. It will be achieved though making use of advanced x-ray computed tomography to no-destructively characterize the three-dimensional representations of aggregate particles (Digital Particle), high performance computing to select an optimum gradation through packing a set of digital particles based on maximizing the particle contacts and loading transfer uniformity, and the digital specimen and digital test techniques developed through a previous project supported by the National Science Foundation to evaluate asphalt concrete?s resistance against permanent deformation, fatigue and thermal cracking. These innovations have great potential impact on designing long-lasting mixes, and more accurate predictions of the behavior of these mixes under real road conditions, leading to extended pavement life and reduced life cycle cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Asphalt paving industries directly and indirectly employ about 900,000 people. Designing and constructing long-lasting asphalt concrete pavements have significant impacts on saving limited natural and economic resources. The project will also integrate fundamental mechanism identification, simulation and visualization into both practical use and teaching of next generation engineers. In addition, the project will tie into an existing Virginia Tech Transportation Institute?s K-12 program to allow these participants have hands-on experience on performing both traditional mix design and digital mix design during their visit. A mini Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program will be managed during the last year of the project to expose the undergraduate students, especially those of minority and underrepresented to the advanced technology and attract them to graduate study in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
