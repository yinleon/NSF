    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2010. The fellowship supports a research and training plan entitled "Why are chromosomes from our maternal grandparents more thoroughly mixed than chromosomes from our paternal grandparents?" for Yaniv Brandvain. The host institution for this research is the University of California - Davis, and the sponsoring scientist is Graham Coop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recombination plays an important role "mixing" up genetic information, and is one mechanism that produces differences among individuals in a population. Although scientists have observed that males and females mix their chromosomes to different extents, the underlying cause(s) and consequences of this observation are unclear. This research uses bioinformatics tools, modeling approaches, and a newly-constructed database to determine which parameters (ecological, evolutionary, life-history, etc.) best predict sex-differences in recombination rates across a broad range of species - from humans and other mammals, to birds and plants. Public data are also being incorporated into the final analysis to gain an even broader view of recombination across a wider number of species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training goals for this fellowship include use of genomics and informatics tools and complex statistical analysis for basic biology research. The results of this work are being disseminated to the public through scientific publication, presentation at national meetings, and communication with media and journalists. In addition to presenting and testing multiple hypothesis, the proposed research also contributes to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms, and their implications both for basic problems in human health and fertility.</AbstractNarration>
