    <AbstractNarration>Guam Community College (GCC) is partnering with the University of Guam, the Guam Department of Education, industry, and government agencies to address Guam's and Micronesia's need for green energy technicians. The goals of the Advanced Technology Developments and Opportunities (ATDAO) project are to produce alternative energy technicians in Guam by (1) generating STEM interest and knowledge among high school students, (2) developing an alternative energy technician education and outreach program at Guam Community College, and (3) promoting secondary and community college faculty participation in local and regional alternative energy workshops. The project is achieving these goals by developing a framework for new courses that will be integrated into existing electronics and civil engineering programs, developing and delivering photovoltaic and wind energy workshops for area high school and community college faculty, training photovoltaic technicians for entry into the workforce, and preparing GCC to receive additional program improvement grants.</AbstractNarration>
