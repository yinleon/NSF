    <AbstractNarration>Like animals, plants contain stem cells that are critical for their growth and development. Plant stem cells are found at the tips of developing shoots and flowers in regions called meristems, where they provide cells for the formation of new organs such as leaves and fruits. Our main research objective is to understand the molecular mechanisms that control flower stem cell activity and pattern the developing fruit into its proper shape. This project continues studies of the ULTRAPETALA1 (ULT1) gene from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana that controls the number of stem cells made by shoots and flowers. We have previously found that ULT1 performs this function by acting together with other proteins to regulate how the DNA of its target genes gets packaged into the cell nucleus. This work will utilize genetic, molecular and biochemical methods to discover the network of genes and proteins that function with ULT1 during flower and fruit development. The expected results of the research are (1) the identification of all Arabidopsis genes that are directly controlled by the ULT1 protein, (2) the discovery of other members of the ULT1 protein complex, and (3) a more complete understanding of gene pathways that organize fruit patterning. Our studies will provide new insights into how plants are able to continuously form and pattern new organs, and will translate into strategies for optimizing the architecture of both ornamental and crop plants. Important elements of this project are integrating research and education in a laboratory setting, and K-12 outreach. UC Berkeley undergraduates from groups traditionally under-represented in science as well as local community college students will assist on the project and obtain valuable hands-on exposure to scientific research. In addition, we will associate with the on-site USDA Educational Garden program to develop a teaching module for local elementary school students that will educate them about the characteristics and life cycles of important food plants.</AbstractNarration>
