    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to connect the cellular microstructure of solid foams to their superb high stiffness-to-weight and strength-to-weight ratios as well as excellent energy absorption characteristics under quasi-static and dynamic loadings. This project uses X-ray tomography to characterize the random cellular microstructure of metallic foams and trabecular bone. The geometry extracted and the mechanical properties of the base material are introduced into micromechanically accurate analytical and finite element models that are used to calculate the mechanical response under quasi-static and dynamic compression; this starts from the initial small deformation linearly elastic regime to the large deformation crushed regime. The uniqueness of the work lies in the analysis of actual random microstructures that may include graded cell sizes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite significant gains in our understanding of the connection between the cellular microstructure and the mechanical properties of foams, the subject remains empirical. The models and closed-form expressions of properties developed in this project can be used to design foams to fit the application or to evaluate the degree of degradation of patient bones, thus bringing science to the hitherto empirical subject. The project will train researchers to become future leaders in multidisciplinary research in academia and industry. The results will be disseminated through journal publications, conferences, university lectures, and through contact with international and industrial researchers in the field. Interaction with industrial researchers also serves to disseminate results directly to users and helps keep the project pointed towards a practical direction.</AbstractNarration>
