    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to explore mechanisms of nonlinear mechanical-optoelectronic coupling processes at frequencies defined by piezoelectric resonances and to develop a family of novel frequency elective signal processing devices that have exceptional properties, such as ultralow power microwave sensors and ultrafast/ultracompact photonic modulators. The approach is to study the principles governing the polarization and lattice phonon coupled phenomena at resonance, both by finite element analysis modeling and by conducting a series of carefully designed electrooptic and microwave-photonic experiments on piezoelectric resonators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits of the Project: The combined numerical and experimental investigations will reveal the defining parameters of the resonance process that combines contributions of the strain gradient, the local polarization, and the displacement current in a non-centre-symmetrical piezoelectric crystal-resonator. The project will lead to an essential understanding of the nonlinear multi-physics coupling process at resonance and to the development of engineering strategies that capture the substantial potential of the piezoelectric resonance defined electromagnetic interconnecting devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boarder Impacts of the Project: The project is interdisciplinary requiring a broad range of knowledge including solid state physics, material science, and electrical engineering. It thus provides excellent research and education/training opportunities for graduate students. The PIs have been, and will continue to be, active in attracting and mentoring undergraduate students in research. The project will help the development of new graduate courses and strengthens the new PhD program in electronic devices at UTSA that is a Hispanic serving-institute with a fast growing engineering research program and a rich pool of underrepresented minority students.</AbstractNarration>
