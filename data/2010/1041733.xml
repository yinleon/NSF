    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a four day interdisciplinary workshop on metabolomics at the University of Florida. It will involve three days will be classroom instruction and one day of seminars for up to 40 students. The design of the program is outstanding from an instructional perspective and in terms of the quality of outside speakers. Importantly, a fine recruitment plan is being implemented and this includes fellowships for two minority participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will provide instruction of the basics of NMR, mass spectrometry, chromatography, and statistics/informatics. The final day will be a series of seminars from prominent researchers to illustrate the frontiers and important applications of metabolomics. They have recruited an outstanding group of lecturers from around the world and have started to advertise broadly for students from United States. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objectives of the workshop are &lt;br/&gt;1. Introduce students to the analytical and statistical skills required for metabolomic studies&lt;br/&gt;2. Identify the major challenges and opportunities in metabolomics for the next several years&lt;br/&gt;3. Introduce basic science and clinical investigators to the emerging field of metabolomics &lt;br/&gt;Highlights:&lt;br/&gt;-Cutting-edge topic, metabolomics, will be made accessible to a broad cross-section of academia from undergrads to faculty&lt;br/&gt;-Top international experts invited to participate and give instruction/seminars&lt;br/&gt;-Great recruitment and outreach plan by a PI who has a great track-record in this regard&lt;br/&gt;-NSF is supporting about half-the other half of the cost will come from institutional (University) and private sources (Metabolomics companies)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are excellent: the recruitment plan clearly emphasizes participation of women and underrepresented minorities. The PI has on-going collaborations with two minority-serving institutions and will bring a faculty member and at least one student from these institutions. Importantly, the data and analysis software from the workshop can be utilized in subsequent teaching settings at these institutions.</AbstractNarration>
