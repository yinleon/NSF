    <AbstractNarration>Scientists from Colorado School of Mines and University of Southern California have received funding to partially support the International Geobilogy Summer course. The goal of this activity is to engage graduate students with different academic backgrounds in Geobiology research merging organic and inorganic chemistry, micro and molecular biology, physics, and geology. Guided by senior researchers, participants will examine processes at the interface of geology and biology and explore the evidence that life's processes have left in the rock record. It is expected that 20 students and 20 instructors will participate each year in research projects that are founded on theoretical, field, and lab work. The course will last for 4-5 weeks; during this time, participants will spend time in the field, at Colorado School of Mines (supported by this grant), and at the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies on Catalina Island, California. Expected outcomes will include conference presentations and publications as a result of the research efforts and new collaborations. An advisory committee, 3-6 senior scientists, will assist in selecting the research themes each year. Additional funding sources include the Agouron Institute, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and NASA.</AbstractNarration>
