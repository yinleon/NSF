    <AbstractNarration>This award will help to help support student attendance at the IEEE Annual Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) in Las Vegas, Nevada, October 23 through October 26, 2010, as well as attendance by qualified postdoctoral fellows who do not have other sources of travel funding. FOCS and its sister conference, the ACM STOC meeting, are the premier broad-based conferences on the Theory of Computing. In recent years the attendance at FOCS has been roughly 250 plus or minus 25. 40% or more of the attendees have been students, for whom the conference serves as a valuable educational experience, both in terms of the technical content of the talks and the opportunities for networking that it provides. This award will provide partial support to twenty or more student attendees, covering shared hotel rooms and travel. (Student registration will be supported by other means.)</AbstractNarration>
