    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The objective of this BRIGE project is to establish innovative research that will implement a multi-signal real-time digital receiver capable of high-resolution spectral estimation on a hybrid high-performance computing platform. The main effort will center on efficiently implementing the hardware to enhance the performance of the digital receiver over its predecessor. Techniques including intelligent partitioning of the signal processing tasks that will utilize the best features of both off-the-shelf graphics processing unit (GPU) and field-programmable gate array to increase the parallel processing capability of the receiver will be thoroughly investigated. The proposed receiver design capable of high-resolution spectrum estimation will provide remarkable improvement in performance over its predecessor and can detect up to 5 signals simultaneously with high instantaneous dynamic range and frequency resolution. This performance enhancement can be attributed to factors such as: 1) use of an analog-to-digital converter with a higher sampling rate and precision, 2) use of 4096-point fast Fourier transform to perform high-resolution spectral analysis, and 3) use of a GPU that can provide performance acceleration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Implications: The proposed research creates ways to make science and engineering more inclusive to underrepresented groups by integrating a number of meaningful education and outreach activities with the proposed research. From an educational perspective, the proposed work will provide research experience to undergraduate students, at the California State University, Fullerton in the area of High Performance Computing (HPC) and digital receiver technology. The other educational activities planned are integration of research findings into core computer engineering courses and introduction of a new specialty track in High Performance Computing for Computer Engineering undergraduates. The outreach efforts will also be made to expose underrepresented minority students at local high schools and community colleges to high performance computing.</AbstractNarration>
