    <AbstractNarration>The human brain remains one of the great mysteries to modern science. A further understanding of the function of the brain has great implications both for how we understand ourselves as well as how we might design modern computational devices. Perhaps the greatest obstacle towards understanding the brain is the vast number and complexity of its component unit cells, or neurons. Current cellular and imaging tools have now advanced to the point where it might now be possible to build complete maps of relatively simple brains, such as that of the fruit fly. This project will support the training and efforts of a team of students who will help assemble the first complete neuron-scale set of structures for a part of the fly brain. Using high-resolution images of individual neurons, the structures of each cell will be determined, and using sophisticated computational tools a complete digital map will be assembled. This map can be used to develop simulations of regional brain function as well as to develop ideas for how complex brains are structured. Experience from this project will pave the way for developing methods to automate the mapping of brains. Finally, a team of students, from high school to graduate level will receive training in modern neuroscience.</AbstractNarration>
