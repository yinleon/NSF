    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Joseph A. Heppert and David R. Benson at the University of Kansas for three summers, commencing in 2010. The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program. The research projects focus primarily on interdisciplinary projects at the interface of chemistry and other disciplines. Sample projects include: (1) the synthesis and study of azulene-based organometallics relevant to molecular electronics ; (2) the high-resolution microscopy studies of model biological membranes; (3) the study of intermediates in manganese-mediated oxidation reactions; (4) the capture and stimulation of macrophage cells for the production of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species ; (5) the spectroscopic study of nano-confined solvents; and (6) the green synthesis of functionally interesting molecules via decarboxylative coupling. In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a wide range of professional development activities, from the exploration of careers in industry through site visits, the development of communication skills through written and oral reporting of research results, and through innovative continued professional development activities via social networking tools. Students will be recruited from a large number of institutions in the region, including a number of schools that are minority-serving.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training. This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in the chemical sciences to a significant number of students who might not otherwise have this opportunity. The research projects supported at this REU site are in interdisciplinary areas of chemistry -- areas where much of the exciting growth in the chemical enterprise is taking place. The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for further study (graduate school), and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>
