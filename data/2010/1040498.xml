    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the development of a novel positron emission tomography (PET) system for plant imaging using an innovative virtual pinhole detector geometry. The new PET system will provide sub-millimeter resolution PET imaging capability. The system will be fully integrated into a plant growth chamber that is fitted with lighting, temperature, humidity and CO2 control so that the plant can be studied in a well controlled environment (including elevated CO2 concentrations).&lt;br/&gt;Radioactive gas delivery system and labeling apparatus will also be developed and integrated into the growth chamber to enable plant imaging using PET tracers under a controlled environment. The system will enable several in planta molecular imaging research projects that may (1) understand how crop yields will be affected at elevated atmospheric CO2 level; (2) improve the yield and extend the shelf life of cassava to aid food shortage problem in Africa; (3) accelerate the selection of genetically modified crops by accurately predicting the yield without full scale field experiment; (4) better understand the effect of plant hormone for growth control and defending diseases. The results of the research and development efforts will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>
