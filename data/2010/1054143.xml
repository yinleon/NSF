    <AbstractNarration>Weevils in the Exophthalmus genus complex are colorful, economically important as pest species of citrus and other cultivated plants, and taxonomically challenging. Approximately 45 species have been described from the Caribbean and Mesoamerica; although field work indicates that dozens of additional species remain undescribed. Most Caribbean species inhabit single islands, suggesting that historical factors, as opposed to adaptation through host plant relationships, have facilitated their diversification. This project aims to resolve the long-standing difficulties of understanding the diversity in this group. A combined phylogenetic analysis of 180-220 species and fossil-based methods for dating divergence times will allow the testing of numerous hypotheses regarding the sequence and relative importance of geological and evolutionary events that have promoted the diversification of these insects. A species-level monograph of Exophthalmus will be produced using modern description tools. A comprehensive e-publication strategy will facilitate the semantic integration of future taxonomic research on this and other beetle lineages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes resources for a postdoctoral researcher, an education associate who will enhance the outreach program, a graduate student, and six undergraduate students who will participate in collecting trips throughout the Neotropics. A far-reaching insect diversity learning program will be launched in Puerto Rico; including (1) the implementation of a university-level course in contemporary methods of biodiversity documentation, (2) on-campus workshops aimed at grade 6-12 teachers, (3) on-site workshops in insect diversity monitoring for people affiliated with the island's leading organization in environmental education, (4) the establishment of a K-12 grade-appropriate insect showroom in association with the UPRM invertebrate collection, (5) opportunities for individual students to conduct research projects adjusted to their skill level, and (6) the on-line dissemination of the outcomes of all educational activities through a newly developed, multi-contributor website.</AbstractNarration>
