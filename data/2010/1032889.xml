    <AbstractNarration>Over recent years, significant effort has gone into ensuring high&lt;br/&gt;availability and integrity of NSF-funded large-scale computational&lt;br/&gt;research cyberinfrastructure. This project targets the improvement&lt;br/&gt;of a particular security component that is widely used to protect&lt;br/&gt;these NSF investments: the open-source "Bro" intrusion detection&lt;br/&gt;framework, which is deployed by major universities, large research&lt;br/&gt;labs, supercomputing centers, and open-science communities. Bro's&lt;br/&gt;popularity is a two-edged sword, however, as it comes with demands&lt;br/&gt;that are often difficult to meet for the small research team behind&lt;br/&gt;the system. Therefore, this work establishes a sustainable&lt;br/&gt;development model for Bro by providing explicit engineering&lt;br/&gt;resources outside of the scope of research efforts, and uses them to&lt;br/&gt;advance the system to a state at which Bro's user community can take&lt;br/&gt;a more active role in its future development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, this project (1) improves the perspective of&lt;br/&gt;Bro's end-users by providing extensive up-to-date documentation and&lt;br/&gt;support, and refining many of the rough edges that the system has&lt;br/&gt;accumulated over time; (2) unifies and modernizes Bro's current code&lt;br/&gt;base that has evolved over 14 years of active development; (3)&lt;br/&gt;improves Bro's processing performance to the degree required for&lt;br/&gt;operation in current and future large-scale scientific environments;&lt;br/&gt;and (4) adds new data analysis functionality in the form of a highly&lt;br/&gt;interactive graphical user interface and a transparent database&lt;br/&gt;interface. By specifically addressing much of the feedback the Bro&lt;br/&gt;team has received from users, the project enables a wide range of&lt;br/&gt;new sites to use Bro effectively for protecting their&lt;br/&gt;cyberinfrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
