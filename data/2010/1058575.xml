    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project will develop to market a new class of assistive technologies to improve the quality of life and well being of the elderly and to reduce the overall burden of the of aging on social and private healthcare systems. The company envisions the digital transformation of the aging process through the application of emerging technologies to change the context of caregiving from a medical to a familial one. Today's telehealth solutions focus on medical aspects and ignore social and psychological needs - a sense of contribution and connection for older adults. Research has shown that social isolation significantly increases the health risks. Conversely, even small increases in perceived emotional support result in significant improvement. The proposed platform has the potential to integrate with existing Health IT and telehealth systems to provide a holistic patient-centric solution, focusing not just on medical needs, but on the emotional and social aspects of aging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three powerful market forces intersect to create a new context in elder care: (1) Reducing rehospitalization has become a National priority, (2) New recognition that family caregiving needs to be an integral part of health care, and (3) Significant shift in age mass. One in five seniors discharged from hospitals is readmitted within the month. Research indicates that a "failing support system appeared to be the most important factor of influence in this respect." The American College of Physicians now encourages doctors to recognize the value of family caregivers as part of the care plan. Supportive social ties enhance physical and mental health among older adults whereas social isolation, loneliness and stressful social ties contribute to a higher risk of disability, poor recovery from illness, and early death. The company believes that there is significant market for consumer-oriented, social-based, self-care solutions that can integrate gracefully with professional medical monitoring solutions. If successful, the effort could kick start an ecosystem of similar, emotional connectedness solutions and technologies that could positively impact the lives of the elderly, and potentially other isolated groups as well.</AbstractNarration>
