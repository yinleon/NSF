    <AbstractNarration>The Tech-Explorer catapult project delivers to students in secondary school a mathematics curriculum integrated with an innovative project-based laboratory experience. Students use power and hand tools to make and assemble parts into a small catapult during class time. Upon completion, students compete with their catapults. The project incorporates "just in time" mathematics coupled with a hands-on experience similar to what a manufacturing or repair technician might do on the job. To strengthen student learning outcomes, the project 1) creates two instructional modules to teach mathematics concepts integrated into making a catapult; 2) connects the modules to California education content standards; 3) tests the modules at six high schools and evaluates learning outcomes; and 4) delivers an in-service summer institute for teachers on project-based learning. Tech-Explorer advances understanding regarding the effectiveness of integrating academic concepts with hands-on projects as a means to increase motivation for learning. Additionally, the project provides students with an experience by which they can gauge their interest and aptitude in STEM education and careers. Project outcomes and curricula are disseminated to secondary and post secondary educators through the in-service summer institute. A searchable Internet database of applied academic lesson plans furthers project-based learning research and implementation, as well as widely disseminates outcomes.</AbstractNarration>
