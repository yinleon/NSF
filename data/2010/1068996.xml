    <AbstractNarration>Electrical power system loads are functions of a myriad of power demands that depend on a variety of factors including time, weather, geography, and economics. The result of the aggregate behavior of many thousands of individual devices switching independently is power system loads that are stochastic in nature. Recent results have indicated that the determination of the stability (or instability) of the electric power system may be adversely affected by the random behavior of the loading patterns. Unfortunately, investigating these effects is hindered by the lack of appropriate algorithms with which to analyze large scale stochastic power systems. Therefore, in this project we will develop the appropriate tools to analyze the dynamic behavior of stochastic power systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This area is extremely timely and pertinent as the level of stochasticity in the loads and intermittent generation sources increase due to renewable energy resources and plug-in electric vehicles. It is important to better understand the inherent risks associated with nondeterministic load models of the system to improve the reliability, resiliancy, and security of the electric power system. This project will address the stochastic factors that impact the transient stability of the electric power system and provide quantitative and qualitative approaches to security assessment and establishing security margins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide an opportunity for educating a diverse engineering workforce in electric power systems. This project will support one women Ph.D. students. The PI and her graduate student will enter into a close mentoring relationship that will include one-on-one instruction not only in power engineering, but also ethical research practices, communication skills, and international awareness. The graduate students will also receive mentorship in classroom instruction and academic career preparation. Furthermore, the numerical methods developments will be incorporated into the next edition of the textbook authored by the PI on computational methods.</AbstractNarration>
