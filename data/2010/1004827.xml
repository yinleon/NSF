    <AbstractNarration>Under the terms of this grant (NSF-DMS-1004827) the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) will administer a travel award program for approximately 100 mathematical and computational scientists, particularly early career faculty and graduate students to attend the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM 2011), to be held on July 18-22, 2011 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The ICIAM congresses are held every four years and are the primary worldwide forum for presentation of advances in the mathematical and computational sciences and their applications to science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Travel awards are especially important for early career researchers and graduate students who may otherwise have difficulty in marshalling sufficient funds. Without travel support, they would be likely to take advantage of this less opportunity for direct interaction and networking on an international scale. This support will help U.S. mathematical and computational scientists keep pace with the advances in applications to technology and science being developed throughout the world. The award process will acknowledge of the importance of diversity, encourage women and minorities to apply, and give priority to qualified applicants. The travel awards will cover air transportation, lodging costs, and registration costs for participants (up to an amount of $1000). They will be awarded to individuals who are affiliated with U.S. institutions consistent with the rules and procedures of the National Science Foundation.</AbstractNarration>
