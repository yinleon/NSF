    <AbstractNarration>This project is to study knowledge transfer oriented data mining (or&lt;br/&gt;KTDM). Given two data sets, the idea of KTDM is to discover models&lt;br/&gt;that are common to both data sets, as well as models that are unique&lt;br/&gt;in one data set. These common and unique models with respect to the&lt;br/&gt;two data sets will provide a tool to leverage the already-understood&lt;br/&gt;properties of one data set for the purpose of understanding the other,&lt;br/&gt;probably less understood, data set. This EAGER project is to&lt;br/&gt;concentrate on models in the form of a diversified set of&lt;br/&gt;classification trees. The KTDM approach is useful for real-world&lt;br/&gt;applications in part due to its ability to allow users to narrow down&lt;br/&gt;to particular models, guided by known knowledge from another data set.&lt;br/&gt;It will help towards realizing transfer of knowledge and learning in&lt;br/&gt;various domains. The project will support a graduate student and will&lt;br/&gt;seek collaboration with experts in the medical domain. These will&lt;br/&gt;increase the impact of the project.
