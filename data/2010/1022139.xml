    <AbstractNarration>The Arctic Ocean ecosystem may respond dramatically to climate change through already observed modification of the physical environment (e.g., hydrography and ice cover). A better understanding of the coupled biological-physical ocean ecosystem, and its interannual variability, is necessary to predict and understand these potential impacts of climate change on the Arctic ecosystem. The Chukchi-Beaufort Sea region near Barrow, AK, including coastal waters, has been identified as key because it lies at the junction of several ocean regions and downstream of the Pacific Arctic gateway and hence is influenced physically and ecologically by input from Bering Strait. Researchers have conducted oceanographic sampling of the coupled physical and biological marine environment in the Chukchi and near-shore Beaufort Seas for five years (2005 ? 2009), including coastal waters, using boat-based surveys during late summer and short-term (month) and year-long bottom-mounted moorings, and have observed significant interannual variability. They will now establish annual surveys of the pelagic marine environment and deploy a year-round mooring in Barrow Canyon as components of the Arctic Observing Network (AON). The surveys will measure a range of biological and physical parameters including hydrography, currents, plankton standing stocks, nutrients, and plankton genetics. The mooring will measure ocean currents, near bottom temperature and salinity, and acoustic backscatter (zooplankton proxy) in Barrow Canyon at a location typically within or beneath the Alaska Coastal Current.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this AON component will provide a 10-year record and enable a better understanding of inter-annual variability in the physical and biological characteristics of the Barrow area ocean confluence. Based on these data, changes in biological characteristics that respond to larger climate change can be detected. This proposed AON component includes measurements of key oceanic biological and chemical parameters, and their coupling to physical parameters from a region sensitive to climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will actively communicate plans and results with the community of Barrow through formal and informal discussions and presentations. They will also support the participation of a teacher in fieldwork for two of the years.</AbstractNarration>
