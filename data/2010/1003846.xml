    <AbstractNarration>Information technology (IT) technicians are a significant and essential component of economic productivity. The number of qualified IT workers is shrinking while the demand is steadily growing. In particular, women and underrepresented minorities are a promising source of talent, diversity and innovation. The Colorado Coalition for Gender and IT (CCGIT) and the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT) are addressing the limited diversity in IT. NCWIT has developed a strategic approach to recruiting women that is founded on a research-based understanding of which students have aptitude, which kinds of degree programs they are likely to pursue and how that is related to what they hope to accomplish in their lives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of six professional development workshops prepare cohorts of community college faculty and advisors to strategically recruit and retain more women in the IT curriculum. Strategies include how to reduce known academic barriers and how to best provide ongoing support. Participation is anticipated by every community college in Colorado. Workshop materials and practices are available for other organizations to adopt.</AbstractNarration>
