    <AbstractNarration>The ability of computers to unify visual information from multiple imaging&lt;br/&gt;modes into comprehensible illustrations will revolutionize the ability of&lt;br/&gt;scientists, engineers, and humanities scholars to gain and communicate&lt;br/&gt;knowledge about the visual world. Achieving this goal, however, will&lt;br/&gt;require a joint focus on developing novel shape and image analysis methods,&lt;br/&gt;and designing collaborative user interfaces that allow multiple domain&lt;br/&gt;experts and illustrators to bring together their expertise. The&lt;br/&gt;Collaborative Algorithmic Rendering Engine (CARE) will be an open-source tool&lt;br/&gt;for extracting and merging visual details available only under certain&lt;br/&gt;lighting conditions, certain wavelengths, or certain imaging modalities. &lt;br/&gt;By focusing on minimal user effort, cross-site collaborative visualization&lt;br/&gt;design, and integrated archiving and process history (provenance) tracking,&lt;br/&gt;the CARE tool is specifically designed to remove existing obstacles to&lt;br/&gt;widespread adoption of digital tools for visual analysis and communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of the project, investigators are developing novel image analysis&lt;br/&gt;techniques that build upon existing technologies such as Reflectance&lt;br/&gt;Transformation Imaging (RTI) and non-photorealistic rendering using images&lt;br/&gt;with normals (RGBN NPR), which have already received enormous interest&lt;br/&gt;within the cultural heritage community. The research includes methods for:&lt;br/&gt;(1) analyzing the collection of images to decompose them into "maps" of&lt;br/&gt;color, orientation, and material at each pixel; (2) performing an arbitrary&lt;br/&gt;sequence or combination of image-processing operations on some or all of&lt;br/&gt;the maps separately; and (3) combining several maps into the final&lt;br/&gt;illustration. The whole process is driven by (4) a user interface designed&lt;br/&gt;for interactive response and including special features that enable&lt;br/&gt;collaborative illustration design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves a close collaboration between a university-based research&lt;br/&gt;group, responsible for development of new technologies, and a non-profit&lt;br/&gt;company with a demonstrated track record of working with museums and&lt;br/&gt;archaeological sites to deploy novel imaging and computational photography&lt;br/&gt;systems. This joint development will ensure that the underlying&lt;br/&gt;technologies will have immediate high impact in the field: cultural&lt;br/&gt;heritage scholars and scientists will be able to generate high-quality,&lt;br/&gt;comprehensible illustrations for scientific papers and textbooks, with control&lt;br/&gt;over selective emphasis, contrast, attention, and abstraction, at lower&lt;br/&gt;cost and greater flexibility than generating such figures by hand. The subject&lt;br/&gt;matter of art history also offers the unique opportunity to stimulate the&lt;br/&gt;interest of students who would not normally take courses in computer&lt;br/&gt;science, broadening the class of students exposed to the tools and capabilities&lt;br/&gt;of computing.</AbstractNarration>
