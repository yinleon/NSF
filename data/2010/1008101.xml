    <AbstractNarration>Jara&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1008101&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator studies the theory and applications of the&lt;br/&gt;numerical inversion of the vector-valued Laplace transform. The&lt;br/&gt;objectives are (i) to extend the investigator's results for the&lt;br/&gt;numerical inversion of the Laplace transform beyond the&lt;br/&gt;noise-free case, (ii) to develop new approximation methods for&lt;br/&gt;the numerical inversion of the vector-valued Laplace transform,&lt;br/&gt;(iii) to show that the inversion of the Laplace transform&lt;br/&gt;together with the theory of finite elements provide a solid&lt;br/&gt;foundation for the numerical approximation of solutions of&lt;br/&gt;evolution equations of convolution type, (iv) to apply the&lt;br/&gt;approximation methods to problems arising from transport in&lt;br/&gt;multiscale porous materials, and (v) to provide research&lt;br/&gt;experience for undergraduate students. The main idea is that&lt;br/&gt;approximation methods for the shift operator semigroup on the&lt;br/&gt;space of continuous and exponentially bounded functions with&lt;br/&gt;values in a general Banach space translates into approximation&lt;br/&gt;methods for the inversion of the Laplace transform of these&lt;br/&gt;functions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Evolution processes arise in many scientific problems, such&lt;br/&gt;as fluid flows, image processing, mechanical systems, relativity,&lt;br/&gt;mathematical finance, and mathematical biology. These processes&lt;br/&gt;are described by the solutions of certain integro-partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations. However, in most of these cases, the&lt;br/&gt;solutions cannot be calculated explicitly because either they&lt;br/&gt;cannot be found or they are not obtained in a plain algebraic&lt;br/&gt;form. Thus, in order to obtain an accurate description of the&lt;br/&gt;evolution process, one needs to develop accurate approximations&lt;br/&gt;to the solutions of these equations. The scalable methods&lt;br/&gt;recently developed by the investigator and his collaborators&lt;br/&gt;concerning the Laplace transform provide accurate approximations&lt;br/&gt;to solutions of integro-partial differential equations of&lt;br/&gt;convolution type. The principal investigator further develops&lt;br/&gt;and implements new approximation methods, and uses these methods&lt;br/&gt;for the accurate description of different evolution processes. &lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate research experience is provided to students by&lt;br/&gt;using the different methods to approximate the solutions of&lt;br/&gt;problems related to transport in multiscale porous materials,&lt;br/&gt;like oil and gas exploration, or controlling underground sources&lt;br/&gt;of pollution such as high-level radioactive waste and&lt;br/&gt;geologically stored carbon dioxide.</AbstractNarration>
