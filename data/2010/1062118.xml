    <AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this project is to provide a new level of technical competence to computing students as well as students from a variety of disciplines in order to have a better educated computing workforce and citizenry. The approach is through discovering and imparting the necessary Computational Thinking skills. Jackson State University is an urban institution and serves students from diverse academic, social, economic, ethnic and geographic backgrounds. They are developing a model for providing Computational Thinking skills, not only to Computer Science students but to a diverse group of students across a variety of disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To this end, this Advancing Computational Thinkers and Computing Innovators in a Cyber-&lt;br/&gt;Enabled Community project aims to serve as a catalyst for increasing interest in and understanding of computing. This effort focuses on the establishment of a new course on Computational Thinking and on the enhancement of the freshman and sophomore level experience by integrating components of computational thinking throughout the first two years of study. More specifically, this project is: 1) Better preparing students for core Computer Science courses by providing students with enhanced problem solving skills gained through Computational Thinking; 2) Increasing student interest in pursuing a Computer Science degree by exposing them to cutting edge research in their Freshman year; 3)&lt;br/&gt;Increasing the retention rate of Computer Science majors by providing a 1st and 2nd year experience that focuses on enhanced problem solving skills and exposure to opportunities for innovative thinking; and 4)&lt;br/&gt;Preparing students across the university with knowledge of computational thinking concepts and skills = This project is also contributing an initial framework for computational thinking for the K-16 community across a variety of disciplines utilizing a variety of cyber-enabled strategies and technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to the newly evolving area of Computational Thinking. It is unique in its approach of infusing Computational Thinking not only through a single course, but through the integration of advanced Computational Thinking modules through the introductory core Computer&lt;br/&gt;Science courses and by introducing advanced computing topics with a goal of fueling innovative thought among students. It is also unique in its combination of strategies by teaching advanced topics in computing through demonstrations and analytical exercises and by teaching core concepts of the same topics through the use of cyber-enabled technologies designed for high school and 1st and 2nd year students. This project is aligned with advocates of computational thinking who believe that it will transform not only Computer Science education but K-16 education in general. In particular, this work seeks to explore the transformative power of Computational Thinking as well as create a framework and roadmap for Computational Thinking for K-16 across a variety of disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;JSU, an HBCU and urban institution, is partnering on this project with both HBCUs, as well as majority serving institutions. This will have a positive impact on a community of students who are underrepresented in the computing and the STEM disciplines. This project will ensure that HBCUs and other minority serving institutions are a part of the evolving Computational Thinking community. It is expected that this project will revitalize interest in Computer Science among African American students through exposure to cutting edge research. We plan to disseminate the course modules and framework resulting from this grant through traditional means such as publications and presentations as well as various computing related pathways, such as the National Science Digital Library.</AbstractNarration>
