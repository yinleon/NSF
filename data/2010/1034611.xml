    <AbstractNarration>Through a partnership between the Center for Coastal Margin Observation &amp; Prediction (CMOP) at Oregon Health &amp; Science University, Portland State University, the Hydaburg School District, and the Hydaburg Cooperative Association, this place-based pilot project is addressing an important geoscience workforce need: the inclusion of Alaskan Natives. Native Americans are among the most underrepresented group in STEM fields despite the fact that tribal groups integrate an understanding of the natural world as an important part of their cultural heritage. This pilot project takes advantage of contemporary coastal-margin understanding and tools to support both the cultural and the geoscience education needs of K-12 students, teachers, and citizens of Hydaburg, a Haida village on Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska. Project elements include student research focused on coastal physical and ecological environments, teacher professional development, and creation of a culturally-tailored suite of curricular resources that incorporate Traditional Ecological Knowledge and inquiry skills. Throughout the project, students are developing valuable workforce skills of relevance to the local community and learning about education and career pathways in the geosciences.</AbstractNarration>
