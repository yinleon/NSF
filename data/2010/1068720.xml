    <AbstractNarration>This award supports an integrated program of training and research in gravitational physics, with a focus on the astrophysics of gravitational-wave sources and sources of very strong gravity. This program is designed to prepare for upcoming observations by advanced ground-based gravitational-wave detectors as well as other planned astronomical measurements of strong-gravity systems. It also complements computer simulations of very-strong-gravity binary systems such as black holes orbiting each other. The research supported by this award will have three major components: (1) Studies of black hole perturbation theory (i.e., what happens when the space-time of a black hole is slightly modified), with a focus on how this theory can be used to refine and extend an existing method for modeling strong-field binary systems called the "extended one-body" approach. (2) Astronomy with advanced ground-base gravitational-wave detectors. (3) Testing ideas that will allow assessment of whether astrophysical black hole candidates are truly the black holes of general relativity. The bulk of the work in these research projects will be performed by graduate students, with an important contribution from undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will help ensure that gravitational-wave detectors reach their full potential as gravitational-wave observatories, opening a new field of observational astronomy. It will also help develop the foundations for probing strong gravity with other astronomical facilities that are under development. This award will support the continued development of a catalog of sounds and videos describing gravitational-wave science, available at the URL http://gmunu.mit.edu. This catalog informs the broader scientific community about the promise of gravitational-wave science, and is an effective public outreach tool. Scientists trained in gravity and gravitational-wave science typically develop a broad range of skills, making them valuable members of the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
