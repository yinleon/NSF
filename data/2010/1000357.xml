    <AbstractNarration>This award is being used to convene an invitation-only, 2.5 day workshop to define student collaborative climate science research. The goal of the workshop, which is being jointly sponsored by NSF/GEO and NOAA, is to produce specific guidance for engaging students, teachers, and scientists in collaborative research about Earth's changing climate, one of the major science topics for the 21st century. Participants will include climate scientists, STEM education researchers, and STEM education practitioners who have experience with implementing authentic student research in formal and informal learning settings. Specific objectives include: 1) defining what it means for students, educators, and scientists to conduct collaborative climate science research and examine the role of student climate-related research in high-quality science education; 2) defining climate-related research areas that are of interest to the climate science community and that can be conducted by students and their teachers, in collaboration with scientists; and, 3) defining within promising research areas specific collaborative research projects in sufficient detail to guide development of implementation plans for data collection, reporting, analysis, and dissemination.</AbstractNarration>
