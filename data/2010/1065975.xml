    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial support for junior physicists to participate in the 2011 Linear Collider Workshop of the Americas which will be held on the University of Oregon - Eugene campus March 19 - 23, 2011. This meeting is the joint meeting of the Global Design Effort (GDE) and the physics and detector community, led by the American Linear Collider Physics Group (ALCPG). The event will include plenary and parallel sessions covering topics of importance to accelerator and detector development as well as physics results from the LHC. Attendance by junior members of the community is a priority for this meeting. Requests for financial support will be solicited from young scientists throughout the United States. A committee of senior scientists will review and select the most promising young candidates, paying close attention to diversity and providing opportunities for under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
