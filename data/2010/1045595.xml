    <AbstractNarration>PI Name: Krishna Nayak &lt;br/&gt;Institution Name: University of Southern California &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: BE-LA: Body Engineering Los Angeles &lt;br/&gt;Proposal ID: 1045595&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will establish a new GK-12 program at USC that will develop graduate fellows majoring in engineering and related disciplines into well-rounded STEM leaders of tomorrow, while introducing cutting-edge body engineering research into urban Los Angeles middle school science classrooms. Graduate fellows will be provided with training and practice in education, communication, leadership, collaboration, and cultural sensitivity that enhances their doctoral training. Each graduate fellow will be paired with a middle school science teacher, and will serve as an in-class science resource throughout the school year. Fellows will develop and deliver original lesson plans incorporating their doctoral research and the research of their faculty advisors. Topics will include: non-invasive sensing and imaging, speech articulation, hand articulation, neuromuscular control, vision and recognition, cardiovascular mechanics, nutrition and metabolism, biological and bio-compatible materials, and human-machine interaction. The intellectual merit of this project includes 1) the research theme of body engineering, which is a strength of USC, and provides an engaging vehicle for demonstrating scientific and engineering principles and introducing university research into K-12 classrooms; and 2) the development and use of powerful pedagogical structures that will help graduate fellows communicate their research to middle school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance of this project includes 1) development of a cadre of graduate fellows that possess the communication, leadership, and collaboration skills, and cultural sensitivity required to become STEM leaders; and 2) development of skills and interest in students at a critical stage for STEM learning.</AbstractNarration>
