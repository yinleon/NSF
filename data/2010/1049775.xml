    <AbstractNarration>The proposed EAGER project will research issues and conduct GENI experiments related to the following two topics: (1) how to effectively ?glue? multiple virtual machines (VMs) distributed across different geographical locations into one seamless machine with Single System Image (SSI); (2) how to make it easier for ordinary people to use and enjoy the benefits of cloud computing when they might be reluctant due to concerns over privacy and security of their data or how to change/customize applications and migrate between VMs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second part of the project will integrate existing social networking services, such as authentication and ?friends lists,? into the GENI control framework, and allow GENI users to share their resources under the VLAN-based SSI framework with their friends. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts: The work on SSI will also contribute to the understanding and advancement of cloud computing over a virtual&lt;br/&gt;data center or multiple data centers. Furthermore, socially-aware SSI represents a departure from conventional resource-sharing approaches and peer-to-peer file sharing approaches. The proposed work will make it easier and more comfortable for mass users to contribute their own resources to GENI and use others? resources made available through GENI. It may become a catalyst for personal and wireless cloud computing that could change the way we do computing and transform the IT landscape.</AbstractNarration>
