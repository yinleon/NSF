    <AbstractNarration>This award will help to subsidize the participation of graduate students in the fourth Northeast Student Colloquium on Artificial Intelligence (NESCAI) to be held April 16-18, 2010 at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. This conference is to include oral and poster presentations by students,invited talks by senior AI researchers, and student-run tutorials. The conference will be largely run by a program committee consisting of doctoral students under the guidance of senior faculty. The program committee will conduct a review process to select the projects chosen for oral and poster presentations. In addition to graduate students, the conference plans to encourage attendance by outstanding senior undergraduates through a special undergraduate track, in the hope that it will increase undergraduate enthusiasm for research and thus the likelihood that they will go on to graduate work. The project integrates research and education and commits to broadening diversity.</AbstractNarration>
