    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of developing a laser-based rapid monitoring gauge for accurate non-contact downhole stress measurement in drilling operations of the geosciences and oil and gas industries. Conventional downhole stress measurement, which commonly uses hydrofracturing, is complex, slow, inaccurate and detrimental to the environment. The proposed innovation features fast non-contact laser interrogation, rugged portable configuration, and on-line data processing and presentation, which offers great convenience for field applications. The proposed stress gauge is environment-friendly in operation as well. This Phase I effort will fabricate a laboratory assembly and demonstrate the research concept. A feasibility demonstration will be conducted on the geologic materials. Successful research and development will result in a non-contact, rapid measurement device for stress evaluation in downhole applications. &lt;br/&gt; The broader/commercial impacts of this research are in two aspects. First, the innovation will impact the 300 million dollar domestic annual market (0.5 ? 1% of the total operating cost) for down-hole stress measurement. The second aspect concerns social impact: conventional down-hole stress measurement is based on the hydrofracturing process, which has been challenged by environmental groups for its potential to contaminate underground water resources. Forthcoming legislation will provide stricter EPA regulation of the use of hydrofracturing. The proposed innovation, if successful, will provide an alternative method of downhole in-situ stress measurement that is not only simple, fast, and accurate, but also environment-friendly in order to ensure our environmental sustainability for generations to come.</AbstractNarration>
