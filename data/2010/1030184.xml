    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that roofing shingle scrap may be blended with asphalt binder through a wet process, in which the ground recycled material is blended with the binder at high temperature prior to mixing with the aggregates. Results of this research may revolutionize recycling practices of asphalt shingles in pavement construction by validating a new approach to incorporate discarded asphalt shingles into asphalt pavement construction. Current practices of dry blending Recycled Asphalt Shingles (RAS) with the aggregates before the asphalt binder is added to the batch are often criticized due to the large variability observed in the asphalt content of asphalt shingles. The proposed wet process may offer the potential to increase the percentage of asphalt shingles used in the mixture and may allow for a better control of the chemical and physical reactions taking place in the blend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed approach has the potential to cope with the increase in construction waste while reducing the consumption of petroleum products in asphalt construction and increase resource efficiency. Educational activities will seek to promote the understanding of sustainability concepts among undergraduate and high school students and to engage students from underrepresented groups into laboratory activities by offering two summer internships for a student from Southern University, a historically black institution, and for one female engineering student from LSU. Proposed educational activities will also establish a partnership between LSU, the flagship institution for the state, and Southern University and high schools predominantly serving underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
