    <AbstractNarration>The Commission on Professionals in Science and Technology (CPST) will partner with the American Institute of Physics (AIP) to: 1) Produce four white papers reporting research findings from existing national data sources about career paths of women, especially women of color with doctoral degrees to be disseminated widely; and 2) Convene a national conference revisiting the important report titled "The Double Bind: The Price of Being a Minority Woman in Science" (Malcom, Hall and Brown 1975).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;Nationally-available datasets like the National Study of Postsecondary Faculty, the Survey of Earned Doctorates, the Survey of Doctorate Recipients and the Scientists and Engineers Statistical Analysis System (SESTAT) have not been sufficiently mined, yet these can provide larger-level comparator information. Intellectually, the proposed project will involve careful work with existing data that conforms to the highest standards of social science research with the proposed white papers subjected to scrutiny by a panel of experts (publications review board). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The relatively small numbers of women of color combined with their dispersion across fields and institutions have posed challenges to ADVANCE efforts to date. By engaging in careful research on information from STEM disciplinary societies and large, nationally-representative datasets, the project will go far in describing the academic lives of women of color in comparison to men of color, non-minority women, and non-minority men. These datasets are available at multiple times therefore the project will document trends for these groups to determine the extent and direction of change over the past thirty years. Extensive dissemination is planned via multiple contexts which will ensure that the information is distributed to key audiences. Meetings, workshops, national conferences, and a targeted conference in the project's final year along with the well-established CPST and AIP websites and the ADVANCE portal will be used to access varied audiences with the results of the work.</AbstractNarration>
