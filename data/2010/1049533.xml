    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual merits. The cycling of fluids into and out of subduction zones plays an integral role in the formation of volcanic arcs. The Central American subduction zone is an ideal location for studying the effects of fluid on the arc and underlying mantle wedge and subducted slab due to its varying inputs and outputs. Existing geochemical studies indicate wide variability in degree of slab hydration along this arc, with maximum and minimum slab contributions to magma generation localized beneath Nicaragua and Costa Rica, respectively. Geochemical studies suggest that slab fluid contributions are also present beneath El Salvador and Guatemala, but diminish to the northwest. Geophysical studies are consistent with a high degree of slab serpentinization and fluid release beneath Nicaragua, versus comparatively little beneath Costa, but otherwise the rest of the arc is poorly characterized geophysically - primarily because the slab is not well-resolved beneath El Salvador and Guatemala. The present study will utilize all available seismic data to extend the velocity model developed for Costa Rica and Nicaragua into the northwestern section of the arc, allowing regional analysis of the relation between seismic structure and fluid distribution. Data reported to the International Seismic Centre will be combined with additional data from local seismic networks from Guatemala through Costa Rica, which has never been integrated to study the entire Central American subduction zone. This study will obtain a more extensive seismic image of the slab and mantle wedge within the Central American subduction zone through the use of a double difference velocity tomography and relocation method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The proposed project will primarily support the professional development of a young female scientist (Syracuse), who has not has prior NSF support. Syracuse will participate in the UW-Madison DELTA program for Integrating Research, Teaching, and Learning. DELTA supports current and future faculty in science, technology, engineering and math in their improvement of student learning.</AbstractNarration>
