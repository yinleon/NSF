    <AbstractNarration>The Eastern Washington University (EWU) Robert Noyce Scholarship Program, a partnership between EWU and the Spokane Public School District 81, is increasing the number and quality of mathematics and science teachers produced annually by providing $16,000 scholarships for approximately twelve candidates per year to result in 24-36 new teachers who hold baccalaureate STEM degrees. Scholarship recipients are placed in inquiry-based classrooms with highly qualified teachers of mathematics or science in high needs schools. The project is affecting the quality of instruction by working directly with the scholarship recipients and their mentor teachers to deliver highly effective inquiry-based instruction. Applicants are recruited through various avenues including "try teaching" science internships and opportunities to work with children in after school mathematics tutoring programs. Freshmen and sophomore students are recruited from underrepresented populations in STEM for summer internships by working with advisors from EWU's Africana, Chicano and Indian Studies. Summer interns work with the Kalispel Tribal children doing mathematics integrated ecological studies at Turnbull Refuge for one week, followed by working with underserved/underrepresented children at the YMCA and a community center for four weeks. By recruiting students from diverse backgrounds, this project is increasing the number of mathematics and science teachers from rural areas, low-income households and minority backgrounds. These teachers, in turn, serve as role models for their students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EWU Noyce program has two major goals: to increase the number of exemplary secondary mathematics and science teachers and to improve the capacity of EWU to educate and graduate highly effective mathematics and science teachers. The methods to meet these goals are based on research on student learning and what people need to know to become excellent teachers. EWU's scholarship recipients learn through inquiry-methods, learn how to use these methods in classes, and use these methods in their field teaching experiences. This helps them teach in ways that improve their students' learning while simultaneously improving their own learning. As all of the Noyce Scholars are pursuing a baccalaureate in a STEM discipline, their depth of content is augmented by the recipients' problem-based learning experiences. The project is also based on what is known about retaining students and new teachers who typically stay because they have supportive relationships. At EWU the scholarship recipients have regular advising sessions with an education advisor and content area advisor, a long-term relationship with their mentor teacher, and an in-person and on-line professional learning community with their scholarship cohort. These relationships are intended to extend into the new teachers' first years of teaching. The advisors continue to be available for Scholars and new teachers have on-going access to a structured on-line professional learning community.</AbstractNarration>
