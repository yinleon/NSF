    <AbstractNarration>This project funds participation in the 2010 ACM Conference on Embedded Sensor Systems (SenSys 2010), held in November 2010, in Zurich, Switzerland. Now in its eight year SenSys 2010 presents novel sensor network and embedded systems research. A highly-selective, single-track venue, SenSys serves as the leading conference in this area highlighting experiences with real systems and experimentation with actual sensors, as opposed to simulations. Maximizing limited resources requires the sensor networking community interface with work done in related fields, and SenSys maintains a wide scope in order to incorporate advances from relevant areas. Supporting this intellectual diversity requires facilitating access for new participants. Applicants receiving funding from this project will be selected through a competitive application process and receive monies intended to cover travel and lodging. Preference will be given to applicants who would not be able to otherwise participate, as well as ones demonstrating that attending SenSys would have a significant impact on the trajectory of their research careers. Extra consideration will be given to increasing the diversity of SenSys through inclusion of women, minorities, and students from small or under-represented institutions. The intellectual merit of this project results from the exposure of selected applicants to the best research in the sensor networking field. Bringing applicants into the exciting, collaborative environment that SenSys 2010 creates will have a broad and immediate impact on the development of new and innovative solutions to the important problems being addressed by embedded sensor technology.</AbstractNarration>
