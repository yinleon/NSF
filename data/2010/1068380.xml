    <AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Leonardo Senatore at Stanford University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observational Cosmology has made great advances in recent years: its results have become vital for many theories of fundamental physics, and it is yielding significant amounts of critical experimental data. Professor Senatore plans to exploit this promising observational situation in order to make definite progress in our understanding of the beginning of the universe as well as its current accelerated expansion. In order to achieve this, Professor Senatore will focus his attention on various projects that explore a wide range of topics in cosmology, ranging from theoretical aspects to subjects closer to the actual data. On the theoretical side, he will concentrate on applying modern quantum field-theoretical techniques to study the dynamics of inflation, the primordial phase of the universe, and the large-scale structures that we currently see around us. On the observational side, the PI will focus on developing and implementing various new data-analysis techniques in order to look for the non-Gaussian signals expected in various fundamental theories of cosmological inflation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professor Senatore will involve graduate students and postdocs in his research, and thereby provide critical training to junior physicists beginning research in this field. The PI will additionally outreach his results to a broader audience by giving public lectures.</AbstractNarration>
