    <AbstractNarration>1010335&lt;br/&gt;Forgacs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biofabrication is an emerging discipline that uses cells, bioactive compounds, biologics and/or biomaterials as basic building blocks to manufacture biological models, systems, devices and products. As biofabrication implies a broad range of physical, chemical, biological, and engineering processes, it is predicated on the collaborative interaction of experts of multiple fields; it is fundamentally interdisciplinary. Due to this distinguishing feature the biofabrication community is steadily increasing. To clearly establish and identify itself it needs representation. This has been recognized by many of the field's growing number of practitioners reflected in a number of recent meetings on the subject. A further milestone in this direction is the recent launch of a dedicated journal Biofabrication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To maintain momentum The PIs will organize the "2010 international Conference on Biofabrication" in Philadelphia, October 4-6, and provide a forum for the exchange of the latest developments in the field between about 100 participants with a strong representation of the younger generation reflecting the young nature of the discipline itself. In recognition of the importance of biofabrication, with the potential to become the 21st century manufacturing paradigm, they plan to bring together representatives of trendsetting, policy-making funding agencies and industrial-commercial organizations with the academic community. Organizing the meeting in the United States will provide an opportunity for US researchers to maintain their international leadership in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biofabrication technologies include those known from the more medically-motivated tissue engineering but in perspective could incorporate applications that respond to numerous societal needs, such as biofuels, environmental toxicology or non-animal food (meat). For its far-reaching implications and sphere of influence, biofabrication requires a multidisciplinary workforce of "multi-lingual" individuals, able to communicate across multiple scientific disciplines and technologies as well as with representatives of policymaking and regulatory bodies, industry and commerce. It is likely that those working in biofabrication will need to be continuous innovators and be at the fore-front of the entrepreneurial elite. The proposed 2010 International Conference on Biofabrication will play an important role in achieving these goals. It will contribute to the strengthening of the international biofabrication community, boost its recognition and prestige, provide an opportunity to showcase its latest accomplishments in the US, and enhance the appeal of the field to the next generation of scientists, researchers and engineers with aspirations for success in the 21st century technological enterprise.</AbstractNarration>
