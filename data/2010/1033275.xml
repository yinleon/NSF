    <AbstractNarration>The main goal of this project is to build a team of&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students in Linguistics and Computer Science to&lt;br/&gt;work on the research project collaboratively. Through this&lt;br/&gt;experience, the students will be able to learn about each&lt;br/&gt;other's disciplines, linguistic properties of many interesting&lt;br/&gt;languages, tagset design, various supervised/unsupervised&lt;br/&gt;approaches to morphosyntactic tagging as well as acquire&lt;br/&gt;mathematical modeling and algorithmic skills -- all while&lt;br/&gt;working as part of the research team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, the PI together with her students will&lt;br/&gt;explore how cross-lingual correspondences can be used for&lt;br/&gt;scientific and technological benefit, and provide a better&lt;br/&gt;understanding of what linguistic properties are crucial for&lt;br/&gt;morphosyntactic transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will play a central role in expanding inquiry-based&lt;br/&gt;learning, fostering student collaborations, and providing&lt;br/&gt;valuable hands-on experience of highly practical work on&lt;br/&gt;difficult, morphologically rich under-represented languages.&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this project is expected to translate into&lt;br/&gt;significant gains in recruitment of minority students through&lt;br/&gt;research training in Computer Science and Linguistics. The&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates who work on this project will collaborate on the&lt;br/&gt;writing of research publications and present at national&lt;br/&gt;meetings so that they can contribute to the research culture&lt;br/&gt;while enhancing their research awareness.</AbstractNarration>
