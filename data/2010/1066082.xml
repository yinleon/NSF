    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop new techniques to overcome the inherent difficulty of obtaining defect-free mechanical linkages using automated computer-aided design techniques, known as kinematic synthesis. Recent research has shown that this can be achieved for planar and spherical four-bar linkages by a stochastic search in tolerance zones provided by the designer in the vicinity of a desired task. The goal is to extend these results to planar and spherical six-bar and eight-bar linkage systems. The result will be reliable computer-aided synthesis of complex linkage systems that are beyond our current capabilities. Deliverables include software for the synthesis of defect-free linkage systems, demonstration and validation using software and hardware, documentation of the research results, and engineering education at the graduate and undergraduate level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will include the integration of kinematic synthesis in modern computer modeling software. The ability to reliably synthesize planar and spherical six-bar and eight-bar linkage system that while complex are able meet the designers goals will provide an opportunity for innovation that currently does not exist. Working engineers, undergraduate and graduate students will benefit from the commercial integration of kinematic synthesis, which provides reliable, innovative, and low-cost mechanical movement in automation for the home, office, hospital, and factory. This will be demonstrated by example software and hardware design presented by video over the internet.</AbstractNarration>
