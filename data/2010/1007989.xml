    <AbstractNarration>Leoni&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1007989&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The central theme of this project is the application of&lt;br/&gt;modern calculus of variations to materials science, mechanics,&lt;br/&gt;and imaging. The principal investigator emphasizes the following&lt;br/&gt;specific topics:&lt;br/&gt; - Material Voids in Elastic Solids with Anisotropic Surface&lt;br/&gt;Energies. Here he studies how the qualitative features of the&lt;br/&gt;equilibrium shape of the void depend on the smoothness and&lt;br/&gt;convexity (or lack thereof) of the interfacial energy. &lt;br/&gt; - Evolution by Surface Diffusion. The principal investigator&lt;br/&gt;studies the short-time existence and regularity of solutions of a&lt;br/&gt;model of second-phase particles and material voids in a linearly&lt;br/&gt;elastic solid. &lt;br/&gt; - Non-Local Operators for Image Recovery. Here he studies&lt;br/&gt;regularity and qualitative features of solutions of a non-local&lt;br/&gt;model for image and signal processing proposed by Gilboa and&lt;br/&gt;Osher. He also takes up problems in water waves and&lt;br/&gt;micromagnetics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The central theme of this project is the application of&lt;br/&gt;modern calculus of variations to materials science, mechanics,&lt;br/&gt;and imaging. When an elastic material is subject to stresses, it&lt;br/&gt;can stretch and develop voids within the material; the shape of&lt;br/&gt;the voids affects other properties of the material. The&lt;br/&gt;principal investigator studies how the shape depends on the&lt;br/&gt;energy at the interface between the material and the void. The&lt;br/&gt;movement of interfaces by means of surface diffusion is not well&lt;br/&gt;understood when the interfacial energy is highly anisotropic. &lt;br/&gt;The investigator studies this problem, focusing on the short-time&lt;br/&gt;behavior; rigorous results here improve our understanding of&lt;br/&gt;various behaviors of materials. He also considers problems in&lt;br/&gt;image processing, water waves, and micromagnetics. The results&lt;br/&gt;and methods developed in the project are incorporated in new&lt;br/&gt;graduate courses, and some are included in a series of books that&lt;br/&gt;the investigator is writing in collaboration with I. Fonseca. &lt;br/&gt;Graduate students are involved in the project.</AbstractNarration>
