    <AbstractNarration>Wireless acoustic communication is the typical physical-layer technology underwater&lt;br/&gt;because of the high medium absorption of radio frequencies and of the scattering&lt;br/&gt;problem affecting optical waves. As of today, however, acoustic communication&lt;br/&gt;solutions support only delay-tolerant low-bandwidth monitoring applications.&lt;br/&gt;Conversely, this research enables near-real-time acquisition and processing of&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous data from mobile and static ocean exploration platforms. Reaching this&lt;br/&gt;goal will improve the efficiency of monitoring key dynamic oceanographic phenomena&lt;br/&gt;such as phytoplankton growth and rate of photosynthesis, salinity and temperature&lt;br/&gt;gradient, and concentration of pollutants. Toward this end, this research studies&lt;br/&gt;underwater inter-vehicle communication solutions aimed at enhancing the capabilities of&lt;br/&gt;the NSF's Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) cyberinfrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;The primary intellectual merit of this project offers the distinction between two forms of&lt;br/&gt;position uncertainty. Typically, uncertainty in the position of a mobile vehicle as&lt;br/&gt;estimated in relation to itself (which the PI refers to as internal uncertainty) is the focus&lt;br/&gt;of distributed underwater robotics and networking. By contrast, the PI introduces the&lt;br/&gt;new notion of external uncertainty, in which uncertainty in the position of a mobile&lt;br/&gt;vehicle is estimated by others. Specifically, this project focuses on modeling external&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty, on designing reliable underwater communication solutions that exploit the&lt;br/&gt;external-uncertainty notion, and on demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating&lt;br/&gt;computation and communication resources on marine science and technology through&lt;br/&gt;emulations and field experiments.&lt;br/&gt;One of the broader impacts of this work is the generation of computer-literate&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate researchers with a comprehensive knowledge in&lt;br/&gt;underwater sensing, communication, and coordination. The PI will create new teaching&lt;br/&gt;modules on distributed sensing, provide opportunities for exchange programs, leverage&lt;br/&gt;existing minority student outreach networks at Rutgers, and incorporate student&lt;br/&gt;exchange programs as well as team-teaching approaches.</AbstractNarration>
