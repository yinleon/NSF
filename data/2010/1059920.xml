    <AbstractNarration>In Cascadia Margin, strong, wind-driven upwelling during the summer months asserts control on particulate organic matter (POM), oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) dynamics in the region. It is the wind-driven upwelling of O2-poor, CO2- and nutrient-rich waters that make Cascadia Margin vulnerable to ocean acidification and hypoxia. A scientist from Oregon State University seeks to partner with an on-going NOAA-funded project to gather high resolution data on POM concentration and composition. Results from this study will be used to (1) determine the spatial/temporal distribution of POM in the water column of Cascadia Margin during the 2011 upwelling season at comparable resolution to the planned measurements of dissolved gases and nutrients by the NOAA group; (2) characterize the biogeochemical compositions POM from different regions and depths of the water column along Cascadia Margin to elucidate changes in its source and reactivity; and (3) relate POM concentrations/compositions to in-situ optical properties to develop algorithms. In addition, because the POM data will complement the spatial and temporal coverage of oxygen and inorganic carbon dynamics to be obtained by NOAA, both datasets can be readily integrated to critically evaluate the role of POM cycling on seasonal hypoxia and acidification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, outreach efforts in concert with the Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence Pacific Partnership would be carried out. In addition, it is anticipated that the scientist would continue his participation in workshops for community college faculty to help improve their curricula, as well as provide high school and community college teachers the opportunity to participate in research cruises. One undergraduate student recruited via the Oregon State Native Americans in Science, Engineering and Natural Resources program would be supported and trained as part of this project.</AbstractNarration>
