    <AbstractNarration>This RUI award funds the research activities of Professor Stephen G. Naculich at Bowdoin College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supersymmetry is a mathematical symmetry that relates bosons, or particles with integer spin, to fermions, or particles with half-integer spin. Since its original mathematical formulation in the early 1970's, supersymmetry has played a significant role in numerous branches of high-energy physics and string theory. Indeed, most of the major advances that have occurred in understanding the properties of difficult strongly-coupled systems have occurred when these systems are analyzed in a supersymmmetric context. Supersymmetry also plays an integral role in string theory, and it is still an open question whether string theories are consistent without supersymmetry. In this project, Professor Naculich aims to study the connections between supersymmetric field theories and string theory. Specifically, he proposes to focus on both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of supersymmetric gauge theory and supergravity theory, as illuminated by their connection to string theory through Dirichlet-branes (D-branes) and the AdS/CFT correspondence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is also envisioned to have several broader impacts. The insights gained, which will be disseminated through journal publications, seminars, and conference proceedings, will contribute to better control over higher-loop effects of gauge theories. This is essential to understanding the predictions of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), as well as to a deeper and more fundamental understanding of string theory. Because this project integrally involves undergraduate participation, it will also contribute to the education of undergraduates by providing training in quantum mechanics, group theory, and field theory, and exposure to research methods in theoretical physics.</AbstractNarration>
