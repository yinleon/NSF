    <AbstractNarration>This project funds US-based graduate students to attend the 2010 USENIX Annual Technical Conference (ATC), the premier forum for advanced professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds. ATC brings together researchers from across the networking and systems community (computer networking, security, cloud computing, and operating systems) to foster cross-disciplinary approaches and to address shared research challenges. This cross-disciplinary emphasis makes ATC well-suited for broadening student awareness and participation in the field. Participation in USENIX ATC?10 and similar conferences is a valuable and important part of the graduate school experience. It provides students with the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers, and exposes students to leading work in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project enables about 11 US-based graduate students who may otherwise be unable to attend to participate in ATC'10. Held June 22-25 in Boston, MA., ATC'10 consists of 4 days of mini-conferences, workshops and training, and a 3-day technical program. Over 500 researchers and practitioners attend annually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students receiving assistance serve as scribes who write summaries of conference sessions for a future issue of the ;login: magazine, participate in the Student Birds-of-a-Feather session, and are strongly encouraged to present posters and works-in-progress. Students are recruited through an open, well advertised process, and selected by a committee appointed by the ATC program chair and USENIX board.</AbstractNarration>
