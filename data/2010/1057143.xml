    <AbstractNarration>With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Sarah E. Reisman of the California Institute of Technology. The goal of Professor Reisman's proposed research is to develop new methods and strategies for the total synthesis of propellane natural products. The first objective of this research is to develop new synthetic methods to prepare chiral amines, such as 4-aminocyclohexadienones. The second objective is to utilize this methodology to prepare by chemical synthesis the propellane natural products periglaucine A, periglaucine B, duaricumine, and acutumine. These molecules have been targeted because they exhibit promising biological properties, including antiviral and anti-amnesic activity, and yet their biological mechanisms of action is not well understood. This research is expected to deepen our understanding of the chemistry and biology of aza-propellane natural products, and to provide new opportunities for fundamental research toward the development of new chemical reactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Reisman will also initiate a new program that seeks to provide mentors to young women in the Pasadena Unified School District (PUSD) interested in pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Studies have shown that good mentoring is critical to the persistence and success of women in STEM fields. Female high school students in the PUSD will be recommended to the program by teachers involved in the Caltech Classroom Connections program. Each student will be "matched" with a female graduate student mentor from Caltech. Because 84% of students in the PUSD are of Hispanic, African American and other minority populations, this program also provides mentors to students in these underrepresented groups. By engaging female high school students directly with mentors from Caltech, this outreach program strives to increase diversity in STEM disciplines by providing mentors and role models for a future generation of women and minority scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>
