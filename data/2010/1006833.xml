    <AbstractNarration>South Carolina Inter- and Intra- Campus Cyber Connectivity &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: EPS - 1006833 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: South Carolina Research Authority&lt;br/&gt;Project Director: Bill Hogue &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will be awarded using funds made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5), and meets the requirements established in Section 2 of the White House Memorandum entitled, Ensuring Responsible Spending of Recovery Act Funds, dated March 20, 2009. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core philosophy guiding South Carolina?s (SC) RII C2-enabled Research and Education program is the engagement of a diverse group of institutions that bring complementary approaches to the research, education, and training of SC?s future STEM workforce. This diverse group ? comprising 3 HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) (South Carolina State University (SCSU), Claflin University and Benedict College), a 4-year institution (USC Beaufort (USCB)), and a rural research and education center (Edisto Research and Education Center (Edisto REC)) ? forms an alliance in support of institutional, NSF EPSCoR RII and state cyberinfrastructure strategic plans. The objectives of the SC RII C2-enabled Research and Education program are to: (1) increase bandwidth and establish distance learning classrooms to more efficiently share knowledge in the fields of tissue biofabrication and cell biology; and (2) broaden the engagement of research centers, community colleges and minority-serving institutions in RII Track-1 and Track-2-supported activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed RII C2 initiative plans to build upon South Carolina EPSCoR/IDeA?s model for infusing research into predominantly undergraduate institutions. The research and education program is organized around two major topics of interest to South Carolina, Tissue Biofabrication and Cell Biology, and Agricultural and Biological Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities would enhance South Carolina?s cyberinfrastructure in support of two active EPSCoR RII programs (RII Track-1: Tissue Biofabrication and RII Track-2: Cyberinfrastructure) and further develop capacity for inter-institutional collaborations in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) research and education. The proposed activities are aligned with institutional, state and research infrastructure improvement strategic plans. The proposal builds on South Carolina?s investment of over $6M in South Carolina Light Rail, a high-speed, high-capacity fiber optic network linking the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Clemson University, and the University of South Carolina (USC). The activities build on C-Light, Clemson?s fiber optic backbone that extends between Atlanta and Charlotte, providing a physical, direct connection to high-speed, high-capacity research networks such as Internet2 and National Lambda Rail. The proposal also builds on the Palmetto State Providers Network, a major building block for reaching some of South Carolina?s 2- and 4-year colleges and universities.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;With the participation of Benedict College and Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College in the SC RII-C2 project, South Carolina will increase the number of minority-serving institutions engaged in its portfolio of RII programs. Benedict College is located in Columbia, SC and is South Carolina's largest private HBCU with an enrollment of approximately 2,800 students, divided evenly between females and males. Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College has a minority enrollment of 1,638 students, comprising 59.7% of their total enrollment. To achieve South Carolina's diversity of workforce strategy, the SC EPSCoR/IDeA program has implemented a number of activities that increase access to research resources at the state's minority serving institutions. Faculty will gain access to enhanced collaborative teaching and research opportunities with colleagues and students across the state, nation and world. Curricula at all participating institutions will be enriched and diversified by sharing expertise and resources across institutional lines. As institutional and inter-institutional curricula are enriched, expanded engagement and training outreach opportunities are envisioned for the region. Faculty and students alike will benefit as continued cyberinfrastructure development scales to incorporate access to national resources such as the TeraGrid and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
