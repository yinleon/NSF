    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to use a cost-effective process of polymeric evolution to yield hydroxyl-terminated aliphatic polycarbonate dendrimers of precise shape to be used in formulating 100% solids two-component polyurethane coatings. The highly-crosslinked core will provide hardness, chemical resistance and toughness in the cured coating. The surface will be chemically modified to reduce viscosity and improve flow. The shape of the dendrimers will be designed to delay the activity of the catalyst, extending the pot life, while also allowing the release of the catalyst for a quick cure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to make 100% solids two-component polyurethane coatings more widely accepted. Currently the short pot life of two-component polyurethane coatings relative to the cure time has limited their applications. By providing extended pot life and increased performance, the dendrimers to be developed in this project is expected to enable the widespread adoption of zero-volatile, thus more environmentally-friendly, two-component polyurethane coatings.</AbstractNarration>
