    <AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Timothy C. Steimle of Arizona State University and his postdoctoral fellows, graduate, and undergraduate research students will study the high-resolution optical and microwave spectroscopy of metal-containing small molecules. A systematic study of metal mono- and dihydrides (MH, MH2), monofluorides (MF) and hydroxides (MOH) for the early transition metal group (scandium to copper) will be performed, with particular emphasis on the determination of electric and magnetic dipole moments, and magnetic hyperfine interactions. This study will reveal insights into the nature of chemical bonding in metal containing molecules, and allow for an assessment of the reliability of computational methodologies. Metal containing molecules such as the di- and tri-atomic systems targeted in this research represent model for understanding a variety of important reactions involving metals, including catalytic reactions. A second effort will focus on high atomic number diatomic metal halides and oxides which are the focus of parity non-conservation investigations. Parity non-conservation is a topic that concerns the fundamental symmetry properties of the universe and the effects are greatly enhanced in polar high atomic number metal containing diatomic molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the aforementioned broader scientific applications of the proposed research to cutting-edge experiments in exciting areas of modern physics research, Prof. Steimle maintains a small but diverse research group, with whom he works closely to train in modern instrumental methods and sophisticated quantum mechanics. The group benefits from a number of collaborations -- both foreign as well as domestic -- which provides his group members with valuable interdisciplinary experience that crosses international borders.</AbstractNarration>
