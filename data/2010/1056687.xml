    <AbstractNarration>With this CAREER award, the Chemical Synthesis program of the Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Professor Stefan France of Georgia Institute of Technology. Professor France will develop methodology for the synthesis of six-membered carbocyclic and heterocyclic frameworks based on Lewis acid-catalyzed homo-Nazarov cyclizations of donor-acceptor-acceptor cyclopropanes. Specific aims include: 1) the use of novel donor-acceptor-acceptor cyclopropane substrates; 2) the use of other functionalizable acceptor groups; 3) the achievement of asymmetric induction through chirality transfer or asymmetric catalysis; 4) the exploitation of carbocation rearrangements as a synthetic tool; and 5) their applications toward the synthesis of complex molecules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor France will also initiate three educational projects that interweave research and teaching. The first project involves an outreach program at a local high school that promotes active learning through the design and implementation of the case study method in science. The second project involves redesigning the undergraduate introductory organic chemistry course in order to eliminate the traditional lecture model. The third project is focused on increasing the representation of underrepresented minorities in chemistry through a combination of recruiting efforts and mentoring activities. Besides these educational impacts, this work could lead to more efficient methods for the preparation of complex organic molecules. Therefore, it will have an impact on any area in which the synthesis of molecules is needed, such as the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural industry, and biological and chemical research activities.</AbstractNarration>
