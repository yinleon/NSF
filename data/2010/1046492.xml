    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a Multi-Axis Repair System (MARS), which is an automated precision alignment and repair planner and driver. MARS will make repair processes much more cost-effective and robust. Insufficient automation in current repair processes is the biggest hurdle in achieving cost-effective repairs with consistency. Due to the complexity of part damage, manual operations are widely performed, which introduces inconsistencies in repair quality. This project will demonstrate the feasibility to develop an efficient and robust planning and control system for precision alignment and repair of a damaged part. A unique centroid-axis alignment algorithm can automate the critical alignment procedure in the repeated repair practice. Adaptive contour printing can precisely and efficiently select deposition parameters and predict deposition height thus will be adaptable to local contour for effective repair. The successful implementation of MARS will result in an automatic and robust repair technology -- the most critical requirement in parts repair. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial potential of this project is a dramatic improvement in cost-effectiveness, repair consistency, and energy footprint. MARS enables batch repair technology, lowers the technology threshold for personnel education and provides a quick response to a repair request. Therefore many repair businesses can be established to serve the local market by delivering consistent repaired parts. As a result, in addition to repairing high value components, medium value parts, such as machine tools or small damaged parts, will be applicable. The repair technology will be an environmentally friendly process by dramatically reducing the usage of raw material, energy input and industrial waste to produce new parts. MARS is a green repair process designed to meet the current sustainable manufacturing challenge, giving it great commercial potential.</AbstractNarration>
