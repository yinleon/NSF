    <AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the College of Earth, Ocean and Environment, University of Delaware, which is located in Lewes, DE. The program will support ten students during a ten week summer research program. This program includes independent research projects by the students on topics such as phytoplankton physiology, marine geochemistry, benthic ecology, wave modeling, coastal processes, marine geology, air-sea interaction and ocean circulation. The program also includes a series of seminars in marine sciences, workshops and round tables to explore general issues in science and graduate education. At the end of the summer, REU students present their results during a mini-symposium and write up their results in a regular scientific paper. Weekly seminars given by UD faculty and staff are designed to provide interns with a broad overview of marine sciences, and informal workshops and round tables focus on topics such as how to write scientific papers, life in graduate school, and career paths in marine sciences. All interns, even those working in the lab, also participate in two field trips.</AbstractNarration>
