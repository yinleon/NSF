    <AbstractNarration>In this NSDL Selection Services project the Concord Consortium is bringing hundreds of its rich interactive resources for inquiry-based science learning to the awareness of the education community by cataloging them within the NSDL and making them available and useful to K-12 and higher education teachers, students, and researchers. These resources reflect a robust research-based development cycle that has functioned over a number of years through multiple NSF-funded projects. They represent the products of important findings and notable advances in educational technology and pedagogy that have resulted from this accumulated body of work, and as such they amplify the strong intellectual merit of this current Selection Services project. The dissemination of these resources through NSDL represents an important development for the education field and makes the broader impacts of the project felt by fostering practitioners' ability to use and learn from these advances and build on them with additional work of their own.</AbstractNarration>
