    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;Following on the success of the first Marine Geoscience Leadership Symposium (MGLS), the Consortium for Ocean Leadership proposes to organize an additional symposium focusing on professional development training for early career marine geoscientists. The five-day symposium will create a network of peers among the next generation of geoscientists and provide them with lessons in early career development to strengthen their leadership skills. The symposium will help prepare scientists by providing training in an array of skills they will need to become leaders, including knowledge of U.S. science agencies and effective techniques to approach decision makers and legislators. We aim to attract scientists from multiple disciplines within or related to marine geology and marine geophysics, including researchers that use scientific ocean drilling as a tool. The proposed activities will include presentations of cutting-edge research, small group discussions, proposal writing workshops, and meetings with funding agencies, media representatives, and policy makers in the Washington, D.C. area.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Ocean Leadership proposes a symposium aimed at providing leadership skills that will lead to success in the academic field and that will create a cohort of early career scientists capable of participating in collaborative research and science planning. Important elements of the symposium will include formal presentations, group discussion, mentoring, and meetings that provide a broader perspective. This type of leadership symposium will address NSF?s primary mission to promote science, engineering, and education careers, while nurturing the next generation of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the symposium is to increase the effectiveness of early career scientists as they enter the community of marine geoscientists. Through targeted training in skills that extend beyond the classroom and laboratory, these early career researchers can become leaders in their communities and contribute to a geoscience-literate public. Participants will be inspired to become involved in science planning and speaking with the media and with policy makers, further expanding the impact of the symposium.</AbstractNarration>
