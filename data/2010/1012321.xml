    <AbstractNarration>In this project supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Veronica Bierbaum of the University of Colorado at Boulder and her postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate student colleagues will study the reactions of gas-phase ionic species. In their multi-pronged studies, they will examine a broad array of reactions involving organic molecules, peptides, metal clusters, and highly reactive neutral species. In addition, the specialized ionization sources and mass spectrometric techniques developed in the Bierbaum laboratory will be further adapted to explore problems relevant to the environmental and biological sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data from Professor Bierbaum's laboratory will be of interest to scientists who seek to understand the reactivities, energetics, and structures of a wide variety of molecules. These results will also be used by theorists to assess the accuracy of computer models and computational methods. In addition, the fundamental studies of molecular reactivity provide critical data that enables the sensitive detection of molecules in process environments and in natural environments. Besides the broader technological impact of the proposed work, Professor Bierbaum brings the excitement of chemistry to a wide age-range of Americans through her work with primary and secondary school teachers and her many outreach activities with their students. Professor Bierbaum will also personally work towards broadening participation in science by continuing to recruit and mentor a diverse research group in her own laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
