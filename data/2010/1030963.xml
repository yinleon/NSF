    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to characterize novel routes to functionalize graphene, while preserving its planar lattice structure and high electron density, and to study the resultant electrical and structural properties and property-correlations. Graphene exhibits a wide range of superior quantum-mechanical properties. Its careful surface-engineering without corrupting its properties can enable its incorporation into several applications. This research will establish the following functionalization routes to minimally alter graphene's lattice and electronic properties: (1) metal-aromatic coordination bonding with metal carbonyls; and (2) pi-pi interfacing with polycyclic aromatics and their derivatives of biomolecules and other groups. The deliverables include: (a) detailed structural characterization: functionalization density, crystallography, and the effect of atomic mass (metal) and electronegativity of functional group; (b) detailed electrical characterization: carrier mobility, carrier density, scattering length scales, band-gap, and the carrier transport mechanism; (c) correlations, theories, and models defining the effect of functionalization on the electrical properties of graphene; and (d) incorporation of the results into engineering student education. Fundamental details about eta-6 and pi functionalized graphene will be uncovered; and their respective spectrometric signatures (Raman, XPS and UV-Vis) will be established. The results will be applied to develop strategies to further improve graphene-functionalization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surface-functionalization of metal and semiconducting nanomaterials has revolutionized science and technology. However, functionalization of graphene is still challenging. If successful, this research will provide novel, non-degrading routes for functionalization of graphene and for interfacing it with physical and biological components; thus, broadening its scope of applications. Results will directly facilitate sensor applications and gate-fabrication for FETs. The nanotechnology base at Kansas State University will be strengthened by development of curricula. The participation of women/underrepresented students in engineering will be positively influenced by collaboration with existing university outreach programs (EXCITE, GROW) for 7th to 12th grade girls. The perspective of graduate students will be broadened by providing exposure to multidisciplinary training in national labs and other research groups through synergistic collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
