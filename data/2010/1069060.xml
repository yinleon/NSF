    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This project supports a workshop focused on the professional development and networking of Principal Investigators (PIs) who have active National Science Foundation (NSF) grants from the Ceramics Program in the Division of Materials Research. The goals of workshop are to: (1) educate PIs about the NSF proposal submission, review, award, oversight and management processes; (2) provide an environment for researchers within the field of ceramics to collaborate and share information about their research projects; (3) improve communication about research accomplishments; (4) address key issues in the field; and (5) engage PIs in discussions to improve processes to help the American Ceramic Society (ACerS) and NSF increase the effectiveness of ceramics research. As well, ACerS will continue to develop the website for this community (http://ceramics.org/knowledge-center/national-science-foundation/) that showcases the accomplishments of the NSF-funded researchers and educators in ceramics. Specifically, this website links together researchers, abstracts of their NSF-funded projects, publications, press releases and other highlights. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: This two-day workshop will take place July 28-29, 2011 in Arlington, Virginia. Each participant will provide both an oral and poster presentation highlighting their research and education activities. The core part of the workshop includes sessions about data management, publishing in high profile journals, membership and studies at the National Academies, and issues resulting in the underrepresentation of women in science. As well, an additional discussion topic will focus on the roles and responsibilities of PIs, professional societies and government agencies. Pre- and post-workshop tutorials cover: NSF reporting requirements, writing press releases for the public, key aspects of NSF proposal submissions, and delivering your opinion in proposal reviews.</AbstractNarration>
