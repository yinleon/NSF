    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal supports travel awards for graduate students to attend the 9th National Graduate Research Polymer Conference to be held at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (June 6 - 9, 2010, Chapel Hill, NC). A number of prominent polymer scientists have accepted the invitation to speak at the conference. The organizers anticipate 200 students (and professors, researchers and industry representatives) from across the country, as well as 50 participants from the Triangle area will come to UNC Chapel Hill campus for four days to share research results and exchange ideas. Symposium topics include biorelated materials, energy-related materials, photonics and electronics, polymer surfaces, nanostructured materials, and characterization/kinetics/theory/modeling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major goal for the 9th NGRPC meeting will be to foster the interaction/networking with professors, industrial scientists/representatives, as well as among graduate students. Efforts toward broadening participation will be included. Ten half-day oral sessions and two late afternoon poster sessions are planned. This conference will provide an excellent opportunity for the attendees to stay current with the state-of-the-art researches and to promote fruitful discussions among researchers.</AbstractNarration>
