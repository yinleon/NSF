    <AbstractNarration>Based on the previous successful WIRES1 conference in June 2009 in Spain; and the positive outcomes of WIRES1, the PIs proposed this summit proposal of WIRES2 to maintain the momentum of the activities and explore creative and potentially transformative face-to-face ways to continue cross-continental engineering research among women. Proposed activities are well conceived and organized with sufficient access to resources.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal seeks to fund the participation of approximately 50 US female engineering faculty at the research summit in Orlando, FL facilitating international collaborations in targeted engineering disciplines of sustainable energy, clean water and health care. The PIs expect another 50-60 female engineers from foreign countries to join this summit and to be supported by their academic or research constituents. The proposal provides a sound rationale, and addresses a real need for a clear pathway in pursuing international collaborations; and expanded databases on engineering women faculty and common issues they are facing.</AbstractNarration>
