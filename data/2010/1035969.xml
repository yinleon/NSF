    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers interested in running novel network experiments at scale and under realistic conditions with the designers and developers of the current suite of infrastructure available through GENI, which is rapidly taking shape in prototype form across the US. GENI has the goal of becoming the first laboratory for exploring networks of the future through innovatations in network science, security, technology, services and applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop attendees will consist of 20 to 30 two-person teams, typically, a researcher and his or her graduate student, selected through a white paper competition. They will be given technical tutorials on the various GENI components and resources and how to launch experiments that span more than one part of the infrastructure (e.g., bridging PlanetLab, Proto-GENI and OpenFlow.) The researchers will also have opportunities to propose experiments and describe the associated operational, workflow, instrumentation, measurement, and security requirements for that experiment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will develop a common understanding of the GENI network infrastructure and build a community of researchers using GENI for their experiments. It is expected that some of these teams will propose their experiments to NSF, which will result in the demonstration of new research ideas and experiments not possible on any other network testbed.</AbstractNarration>
