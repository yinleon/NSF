    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of using vibrations to dislodge and remove contaminants accumulated on ceramic filters. Filter Sensing Technologies (FST) has targeted diesel particulate filters (DPF) as a promising application, since they are expensive and in widespread use to meet mandated emissions regulations. Over time these filters become plugged with ash, which current cleaning systems can not easily remove, as the ash packs in plugs at the end of the channels. Inefficient cleaning results in fuel penalties, added maintenance costs, and reduces the filter?s life. FST proposes to use vibrations to remove ash more effectively than current cleaning methods. This research will investigate the efficacy of this system to break-up and remove ash from the DPF, while ensuring filter integrity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are that it can satisfy a significant unmet need to improve DPF ash cleaning, providing both cost savings and environmental benefits. Current ash cleaning systems range in price from $25,000 to over $100,000 and all leave some residual ash in the DPF. FST?s proposed cleaning system can provide annual fuel and maintenance cost savings to the end-user of over $2,500 for a typical heavy-duty truck, at a fraction of the cost. Current estimates show the US and European DPF cleaning market will generate over $6B in revenues in 2010 and nearly double by 2014. FST?s technology provides a more effective, simpler, and less expensive solution, enabling fuel savings and improved emission control system performance.</AbstractNarration>
