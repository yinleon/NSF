    <AbstractNarration>This project contributes to the exciting field of geo-stream processing. &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, an integrated real-time geo-stream processing and monitoring &lt;br/&gt;system called AegisDB will be built and the research environment and results &lt;br/&gt;will be leveraged to stimulate learning at the K-12, undergraduate, and &lt;br/&gt;graduate levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AegisDB system includes a Geo-Stream Algebra which uses a data-type-&lt;br/&gt;based approach as opposed to a traditional tuple-based approach for &lt;br/&gt;representing and querying geo-streams. The STREAM data types of the &lt;br/&gt;algebra unify static data, traditional streams, geo-streams from fixed &lt;br/&gt;locations, and geo-streams that move. The proposed Aggregate Algebra &lt;br/&gt;generalizes the operator GROUP BY to generalized aggregations (GAs) &lt;br/&gt;and bridges the fundamental gap between point observations from sensors &lt;br/&gt;and spatio-temporally continuous phenomena. Several novel &lt;br/&gt;spatial-centric operator optimization techniques are proposed, &lt;br/&gt;which include a velocity-based filtering that utilizes the physical &lt;br/&gt;limitations of most moving objects and a spatial-coverage-based query &lt;br/&gt;combination that combines geo-stream queries based on &lt;br/&gt;their intended spatial coverage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed AegisDB system will transform the ways to define and monitor &lt;br/&gt;more sophisticated spatio-temporal events for alerting purposes. The result is &lt;br/&gt;the significantly improved realtime access to important spatio-temporal events &lt;br/&gt;related to our lives by professionals and the general public. The system will &lt;br/&gt;be critical for important domains including transportation, environmental &lt;br/&gt;science, hazard monitoring, and emergency responses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has strong education and outreach components. Environmental &lt;br/&gt;models for K-12 teachers and students using real-time environmental datasets &lt;br/&gt;will be designed. An informal session on how to collect, store, and distribute &lt;br/&gt;environmental data will be presented through the Family Fun Science &lt;br/&gt;Saturday events of the Elm Fork Education Center of UNT. A course module &lt;br/&gt;on geo-stream processing will be developed. Women and minorities will be &lt;br/&gt;recruited into the research project. Undergraduate students looking for &lt;br/&gt;research opportunities will be mentored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information concerning this project see the project web page: &lt;br/&gt;URL: http://www.cse.unt.edu/~huangyan/AegisDB/</AbstractNarration>
