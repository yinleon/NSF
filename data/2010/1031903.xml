    <AbstractNarration>All mobile organisms spend much of their lives searching for something, be it food, water, shelter, or others of their kind. Searching uses perception, memory, cognition, and action. It can occur over vast landscapes and periods of time, as in whale migration behaviors. It can occur in under a second on the basis of fleeting bits of sensory evidence, as in frogs searching their visual fields for flies. And it occurs on all scales in between, across organisms but also across different behaviors of a given organism. Human search is especially diverse in this regard because human searches range from subatomic to human to cosmic scales of exploration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Christopher Kello is leading a team of researchers at the University of California, Merced, in the study of human search behaviors in three very different but complementary domains: Foraging over large virtual spaces, visual searches over scenes and movies, and memory searches over words and concepts. The generality and evolutionary importance of search suggests that search functions may share common principles across scales and domains. Evidence for this conjecture has been found in "Levy distributions" that describe the frequencies with which segments of different lengths occur in search paths. These frequencies are observed to obey a common scaling law across a wide range of different search behaviors but current evidence is not sufficient to determine the meaning of this law.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With mentorship from three faculty members in Cognitive and Information Sciences, undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow will collaborate on experiments and computational models in each of the three domains of interest, in a unique and highly interdisciplinary education and research experience.</AbstractNarration>
