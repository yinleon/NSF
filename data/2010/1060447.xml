    <AbstractNarration>The Advancing Computing Education through Synergistic Support (ACESS) program at Winston-Salem State University provides financial support for highly qualified, though economically disadvantaged, students to enroll in and complete Computer Science and Information Technology BS degree programs. Scholarships are also offered to undergraduates majoring in chemistry, biology or mathematics who minor in computer science or information technology. The program also seeks to enroll women and students with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACESS Scholars receive mentoring from both faculty and upper level students. They are encouraged to participate in research experiences and receive financial support to attend at least one annual conference. Many present the results of their research experiences at regional and/or national conferences. ACESS Scholars receive career counseling and attend at least one job fair. Most ACESS Scholars develop additional professional skills by participating in local chapters of computing organizations such as the ACM, National Society of Black Engineers, or the Society of Women Engineers; or they join the Game Programming Club or the Robotics Group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Offered by a Historically Black College and University (HBCU), the ACESS program increases the number of highly trained, underrepresented computing professionals as well as developing a new generation of computer science and information technology leaders and researchers.</AbstractNarration>
