    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Education Digital Library (ChemEd DL) has developed a broad range of resources and services involving Web-delivered chemistry instructional materials for teachers and students from K-16 educational levels. This project is identifying areas where the ChemEd DL lacks materials, is adding new resources in those areas, is amalgamating individual resources into larger units that teachers and students can easily use, and is developing pedagogic documentation of best educational practices in using its resources. These goals are being achieved by mobilizing participants in already-planned ChemEd DL workshops to evaluate resources, add new ones, combine resources into larger units, and describe successful pedagogy based on those units. This process is being facilitated by the NSDL Pedagogic Service, which is providing a clearinghouse for descriptions of exemplary uses of online instructional materials. The project is also collaborating with the STEM Exchange project of the NSDL Resource Center. The project is using social networks as a means of dissemination of the pedagogic information and resources it develops. This is enhancing both discoverability and usefulness of ChemEd DL materials for teachers and hence is bringing to many more students excellent online learning materials. By improving chemistry education, the project is increasing the number and skills of the nation's scientific and technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>
