    <AbstractNarration>In the area of eyewitness identification, few studies compare showups (one-person identifications), simultaneous lineups (all lineup members viewed simultaneously), and sequential lineups (lineup members viewed one at a time) to determine which is most accurate. The current research involves a series of experiments in which participants will first watch a staged video of multiple perpetrators breaking into a storage unit and then complete a showup, sequential lineup, and simultaneous lineup, each involving a different suspect. Finally, participants will indicate their confidence in their decision and complete additional questions about the manipulation and witnessing experience. The current research has three objectives: to compare identification accuracy between showups and lineups within a single set of studies; to develop techniques that improve eyewitness identification; and to promote a better understanding of the underlying memory and decision-making processes that occur in showup and lineup identifications using formal computational models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on improving eyewitness identification in showups and reducing the fallibility of eyewitness evidence leading to the wrongful conviction of the innocent.</AbstractNarration>
