    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the effectiveness of forming novel carbon nanofibers by a gas jet process (NGJ) and confirm performance benefits as these nanofibers are incorporated into polymer systems. Carbon fibers of various diameters enhance a broad range of materials and products to increase the strength-to-weight ratio and improve thermal and electrical properties of composite structures. However, a substantial gap in available fiber diameters exists between the largest nanofiber (100 nm) and the smallest microfiber (3000 nm). A similar gap exists in the aspect ratio of the fibers. Laboratory demonstrations have shown the NGJ process produces fibers that fill these gaps. The objectives of this project are to develop the equipment and procedures that demonstrate the high volume and low cost advantages of NGJ nanofibers reproducibly in important applications. This project consists of 1) design and fabrication of pilot scale equipment, 2) production and characterization of nanofibers, 3) preparation of composite samples, and 4) comparison of composites reinforced with NJG nanofibers to those reinforced with commercially available nanofibers. The results of this research will prove the advantages of the NGJ nanofibers and their commercial viability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Completion of this project will provide an understanding of the impact of larger diameter, higher aspect ratio carbon nanofibers on composite polymer performance. Additionally, the design and optimization of composite components and the process controls of fabrication will be improved by the availability of a wide range of diameters of the graphitic reinforcing nanofibers fibers. Also, fundamental morphological differences will be revealed in the way that graphene-like sheets are arranged in fibers of varying diameters produced by the NGJ process. This project will lead to the commercialization of low cost, high performance carbon nanofibers with unique mechanical properties. Benefits to society from these materials will include lighter weight, higher strength components utilized in most automobiles, which will reduce fuel consumption. Also, when used as affordable high performance fillers in lithium ion battery electrodes, these carbon nanofibers will help electric cars achieve mass appeal. Additional benefits will arise from the significant performance improvements and cost reductions that occur as the low cost, high performance materials are incorporated into manufacturing processes, packaging products, adhesives, and many other supply chain materials.</AbstractNarration>
