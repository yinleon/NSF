    <AbstractNarration>The research supported by this award addresses the exciting phenomena resulting from the extremely nonlinear interaction of a macroscopic number of atoms with an intense laser pulse. The coherent extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation generated in this process presents a unique and versatile source for spectroscopy, coherent control, and femtosecond/attosecond dynamics. Some of the sub-projects of the award will explore novel ways to optimize and control the XUV generation process, and other sub-projects aim at using the XUV light as a diagnostic of the quantum dynamics that produced it. The work will be accomplished through the continued development and application of an ab-initio, non-adiabatic theoretical model for the interaction of atoms in the gas phase with ultrashort laser pulses. This "numerical non-linear medium" allows for the complete simulation of the most advanced short pulse laser experiments from first principles. The majority of the calculations envisioned are directly relevant to ongoing collaborations with four experimental groups at the forefront of ultrafast strong field physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coherent, ultrafast XUV pulses allow for probing and manipulating atomic, molecular and biological processes at few-femtosecond and sub-femtosecond time scales, yielding new ways to understand and control matter via its interaction with light. Ultrafast strong-field physics continues to be dominated by European groups, with strong efforts also underway in Asia. The research supported under this award will strengthen the US presence in this field, and will help train the next generation of scientists in this interdisciplinary field of atomic, molecular and optical science. Postdoctoral researchers and graduate/undergraduate students will gain a broad education in both atomic physics and high intensity laser science. Through close collaborations with experimental groups they will have a thorough understanding of the experimental as well as the theoretical issues involved.</AbstractNarration>
