    <AbstractNarration>This conference proposal, organized by the National Center for Science and Civic Engagement, is convening professionals both in higher education and in informal science education, all of whom have done work or are seriously interested in the interface of science, society and civic engagement. The purpose of the conference is to build bridges between and explore new connections among these communities around their mutual interests in emerging educational practices that promote self-directed learning in STEM through connections with matters of civic consequence.</AbstractNarration>
