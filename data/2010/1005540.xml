    <AbstractNarration>Quantum information science (QIS) is the interdisciplinary field that investigates how to use systems obeying the laws of quantum mechanics to perform information-processing tasks. Research under this grant draws from two QIS questions: What is the role of quantum entanglement in quantum information processing? What is the best way to deploy quantum systems, perhaps entangled, to make measurements of classical parameters? These two questions expand to four specific research projects, which are the focus of work under this grant: (i) super-Heisenberg sensitivity scaling, phase coherence, and entanglement in Bose-Einstein condensates; (ii) mixed-state quantum computation and measures of nonclassical correlations; (iii) Clifford circuits, stabilizer states, and local-hidden-variable models; and (iv) fundamental limits to high-precision measurements. These four research projects will be carried out within the environment of the Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC), a PIF-sponsored center based in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of New Mexico, with an experimental component at the College of Optical Sciences of the University of Arizona.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students supported by this proposal will work within the CQuIC framework, with its proven track record of training PhD students and involving undergraduates in research. CQuIC students are exposed to the interdisciplinary ideas of QIS through a high-level, weekly seminar series and through the weekly CQuIC group meeting, at which papers posted to the e-print server arXiv.org are reviewed and discussed and at which students and postdocs receive intensive training in the art of giving technical talks. CQuIC organizes a visitors program that brings in distinguished scientists for short- and long-term visits, thereby exposing students to additional perspectives and expertise, and provides the opportunity for research exchanges and collaborations with four external partners. CQuIC is also the administrative home for the Southwest Quantum Information and Technology Network (SQuInT), which is a major community-building activitity in QIS, involving about fifteen institutions based mainly in the US Southwest.</AbstractNarration>
