    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Early-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research(EAGER)award is to determine the feasibility of combining elements of intuitive ideation methods with logical/experiential methods to investigate the creation of a holistic framework that will contain ideation strategies from both types. Engineering creativity lies at the intersection of originality and functional quality. A large number of structured ideation methods and tools have surfaced for enhancing engineering design creativity. They can be classified into intuitive and logical/experiential approaches, both of which have deficiencies. Intuitive and logical/experiential approaches represent opposite extremes. Given the diversity of design problems and designers, it is unlikely that the exclusive use of a single method or tool, whether intuitive, logical or experiential, would always lead to creative solutions. In this EAGER award, the feasibility of combining elements of these two approaches - intuitive ideation with logical/experiential - in order to overcome limitations of each and to expand the potentials for ideation will be explored. The foundations will be laid for a prototype Testbed for design and for creativity research. Preliminary investigations will be performed to determine if selected parts extracted from them can be combined with intuitive strategies. The experiential strategies to be included during the exploratory stage are: decomposition, abstraction, analogical reasoning, example exposure and conflict resolution. The intuitive strategies included will be: suspended judgment, incubation, provocative stimuli, action verbs and combinatorial play. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this EAGER award will be a preliminary step towards Testbeds that will provide a uniform and structured way of collecting data on creative design. This will lead to a better understanding of creative processes and strategies through empirical studies. By dissecting ideation methods, rather than using them in their entirety for empirical studies, the investigators will research at a finer granularity level (mini-strategies) for greater insights into design creativity. Studying the combination of intuitive and logical/experiential ideation in terms of how problems are posed in each and the ideation stage, problem type, designer type is unique and challenging. Success of this effort will lead to more extensive research on this topic. The impact could be extremely significant, given the importance of ideation to the engineering design process.</AbstractNarration>
