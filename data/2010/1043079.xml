    <AbstractNarration>This project tests the adaptability and adoptability of on-line case studies as the basis for student groups to use Problem-based Learning to master complex concepts in biology and chemistry. A group of faculty from the University of New Mexico has used this approach successfully in biochemistry courses there. To learn whether the approach can be used at different types of institutions, they are collaborating with faculty at San Juan College to help them to develop and implement it among the San Juan students of introductory biology and chemistry. San Juan College is a rural community college in northwestern New Mexico, and is a federally designated Native American Serving Non-Tribal Institution. Its student population also includes a significant Hispanic presence. Despite the significant physical and cultural distance between the two schools, the collaboration succeeds by the use of workshops for development of the case studies and ongoing support and mentoring of the San Juan faculty using electronic means of communication. Groups of students working on the case studies also use electronic tools to investigate the cases and to respond to assessments designed to test their mastery in several different domains of learning. When needed, faculty assistance can also be provided electronically. Distance thus becomes far less an obstacle in development of this learning community. Support for this project is provided by EHR/DUE and by the EPSCoR program.</AbstractNarration>
