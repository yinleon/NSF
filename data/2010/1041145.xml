    <AbstractNarration>This project examines the large anticyclonic high pressure systems found over the oceans on the western sides of the Southern Hemisphere subtropical landmasses. These features are generally regarded as the Southern Hemisphere equivalents of the Bermuda High and the Pacific High in the Northern Hemisphere, but this research will examine the extent to which the Southern Hemisphere anticyclones are different from their northern counterparts and are affected by the geography and climatology of the Southern Hemisphere. Three broad questions are addressed: 1) How is the South Atlantic anticyclone during the southern winter connected with the West African and Asian monsoons? 2) How significant are the interhemispheric influences of the Atlantic Warm Pool on the southeastern Pacific? 3) In the Southern Hemisphere, do atmospheric-ocean interactions contribute significantly to the links between monsoons and tropical highs? These research questions are addressed primarily through numerical experiments with atmospheric general circulation models and coupled atmosphere-ocean-land climate models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The southern subtropical anticyclones are important features of the earth's climate, and research leading to a better understanding their origins could lead to improvements in their representation in climate models. The stratus clouds found in conjunction with the anticyclones are quite important for the Earth's energy budget, and better representation of the anticyclones in climate models may help us to produce better climate model projections of future climate change. In addition, the work will provide education and training to a graduate student and two postdoctoral researchers.</AbstractNarration>
