    <AbstractNarration>1065545&lt;br/&gt;Fouad&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports an international research experience for students in a project involving a team at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, led by Dr. Fouad H. Fouad in collaboration with a team of Egyptian scientists led by Dr. Moustafa El-Demirdash, Chairman, Housing and Building Research Center (HBRC), Cairo, Egypt. The project will support researchers, graduate and undergraduate students from the U.S. universities for carrying research projects on sustainable green building design and construction. The project will support 18 undergraduate and graduate students to conduct research in Egypt in coordination and with mentorship from the staff at the HBRC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The program focuses on the science and technology of sustainable green building design and construction. The urgency of this research is dictated by the rising cost of energy, the limited natural resources, and the need to protect our environment. The seven specific research projects proposed for student research will pioneer the development of new concrete materials and building systems for solving urgent environmental challenges. These projects will advance new knowledge and discoveries and will help bring about breakthroughs in the global challenge of affordable and energy-efficient construction materials and systems. There is a pressing need to educate a cadre of engineers and scientist that are capable of performing in an international research environment. The PI has developed strong working relationships with several universities and research centers in Egypt, which will contribute to the success of the proposed program. In addition to the international research experience, the IRES students will be able to enhance their professional network and build future international collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The project directly addresses the challenging issue of environmental sustainability and carbon released into the air. The seven specific research projects proposed will contribute to the current building construction practice by introducing low-cost, energy-efficient materials and systems. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and on a dedicated program Web site. The knowledge obtained through this research will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses in UAB Civil Engineering. Future engineers will thus be made aware of the progress in the area of sustainable environment. With 40% minority student body and active partnerships with historically black colleges and universities, UAB is in a position to attract underrepresented groups to research careers in science and engineering through the proposed project. It is anticipated that the project will lead to new research exchanges and partnerships with HBRC and universities in Egypt. This will broaden UAB's capabilities for providing global research training and education to U.S. faculty and students.</AbstractNarration>
