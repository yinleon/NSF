    <AbstractNarration>Phospholipids are a major structural component of biological membranes, forming lipid bilayers. In addition, these molecules play roles in signal transduction and vesicular trafficking, serve as membrane anchors for proteins and carbohydrates, and often regulate enzymes and transport proteins. Phosphatidylcholine (PC), the predominant lipid in eukaryotic membranes, can be synthesized by methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine and via the CDP-choline pathway. The aim of this project is to determine the role of the CDP-choline pathway in phosphatidylcholine synthesis in Leishmania, a genus of trypanosome protozoa. The contribution of several synthetic routes to PC will be evaluated in cultured cells and confocal microscopy will be employed to determine the cellular location of enzymes involved in PC synthesis. The scope of the research project also includes characterization of recombinant forms of two enzymes of the CDP-choline pathway from Leishmania species, choline kinase, which phosphorylates choline to form phosphocholine, and CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase, which transfers a cytidine nucleotide to phosphocholine. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to the greater body of knowledge with respect to phospholipid synthesis, providing information important for understanding synthesis of phosphatidylcholine in trypanosomes. Completion of the research relies on significant participation from undergraduate students majoring in chemistry, biochemistry, and/or molecular biology. The students will benefit from participation in independent research and exposure to biochemical and molecular biological laboratory techniques. A major goal of the project is to provide the opportunity for students to present research results at regional and national meetings upon completion of their projects. A quality research experiences gives students the confidence they can succeed and serves as a driving force for the remainder of their careers. Support for research projects that target undergraduates is vital for keeping our nation's students excited about being a scientist at the pivotal undergraduate stage of their academic careers.</AbstractNarration>
