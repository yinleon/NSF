    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is to acquire a mask aligner for photolithography (from mm to 0.6 micrometer scale) and a nanometer pattern generation system to be attached to the existing SEM for sub-100 nm e-beam lithography (EBL). Microfabrication, originally developed for silicon-devices and integrated circuits, has become an essential technology to explore properties of new materials, such as graphene and metamaterials, and create devices with novel functionalities, such as sensors and nano/microelectrical-mechanical-systems (N/MEMS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Combined with the existing equipment at Utah State University?s Nanoscale Device Laboratory (NDL), these two additions will enable, for the first time at USU, the characterization of new materials and the creation of novel devices for a number of cross-disciplinary research projects. Once the equipment is set up and capabilities are highlighted from these currently underway projects, it is expected that more researchers will use NDL to explore the unlimited world of micro/nanoscale devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Acquiring the requested system will be a significant research infrastructure improvement for USU and will undoubtedly help USU to recruit faculty and students interested in nanoscale science and engineering. Students, including underrepresented groups, working at NDL will receive invaluable training in the basics of microfabrication allowing them to carry out research more efficiently at national nanofabrication facilities. NDL has been involved in open-house and class-demonstrations, and further activities involving microfabrication are planned. More industrial partnerships will be actively pursued at NDL not only to commercialize successful prototypes but to stimulate research focusing on the needs of society.</AbstractNarration>
