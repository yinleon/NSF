    <AbstractNarration>CAREER: Power Electronics and High Voltage Intensive Solutions for Very Large Scale Megawatt Photovoltaic Systems&lt;br/&gt;(Abstract)&lt;br/&gt;Research Objectives and Approaches &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to significantly enhance the efficiency and lower the cost of very large scale (VLS) megawatt photovoltaic (PV) power plants. The approach is to derive and realize a new generation of power electronics circuits and associated control strategies for a hybrid PV-battery system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit &lt;br/&gt;First, a circuit analysis framework for multiple-input converters will be derived. Based on this framework, the best circuit for battery integration at the PV module level in VLS systems will be identified. Then, a new breed of SiC-based switched capacitor converter/inverters will be derived. In particular, a switched capacitor inverter will be studied. The inverter will have boost function, multiple voltage levels, redundant switching statues, and low voltage stresses on switches and capacitors. All these new circuits will be implemented in a hybrid PV-battery system to 1) maximize the total power output of all the PV cells, 2) reduce the cost of battery monitoring and balancing circuits, and 3) eliminate line transformers, filters, and centralized inverters for battery packs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;Calculated from published numbers, the proposed research will create at least $3.4 billion in cost savings per year. The project will also include a comprehensive education plan: at the K-12 level, a collaborative one-day Solar Energy/Smart grid workshop will be established to reach 2000+ Ohio teachers; a hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform will be utilized for teaching activities at both the undergraduate and graduate levels; and a long-term internship program with the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez will be developed.</AbstractNarration>
