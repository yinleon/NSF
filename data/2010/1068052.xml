    <AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Alakabha Datta at the University of Mississippi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Standard Model of particle physics is built around the observation that nature contains three separate generations of quarks and leptons. These generations of particles all appear identical in terms of their charges and interactions, and differ only in their masses. They also mix amongst each other in non-trivial ways that lead to CP violation. ``Flavor physics'' is a general term that encapsulates the physics of this generational structure, and there is currently a huge amount of data from flavor experiments. In his research, Professor Datta aims to develop methods that will help to distinguish different new physics models by using this data. He also plans to use flavor symmetries in order to understand the origin of quark and lepton mixing, and he intends to study processes that can probe non-standard couplings of the Higgs boson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is also expected to have significant broader impacts. Professor Datta will involve a graduate student in his research, thereby providing training to a junior physicist beginning research in the field of flavor and Higgs physics. Professor Datta also plans to give talks about his research at various colleges and high schools in Mississippi and surrounding areas with the aim of attracting students from under-represented groups to scientific research.</AbstractNarration>
