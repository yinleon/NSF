    <AbstractNarration>10223373&lt;br/&gt;Barat&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal covers initial experiments to prove out a new family of catalysts which will carry out the biologically-inspired selective partial oxidation of methane. Products are likely methanol, but potentially some alkane hydrocarbons may be formed from C-C coupling reactions. It is clear that partial oxidation to methanol is the most economical and logical reaction choice. One would desire a catalyst with more selectivity during the oxidation step. The PIs step through an analysis of the options: heterogeneous, homogeneous, biological, whole cell, and biomimetic, weighing the possibility for success. They are left with what they term the bio-inspired approach. By further analysis they arrive at the choice of perfluoroalkyl metal phthalocyanine (an analogue of porphyrin) as a very likely catalyst for improved selectivity and also the possibility of C-C coupling catalysis as well. Some supporting calculations are consistent. Note that what is desired is a low temperature and pressure operating regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Aspects:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an EAGER proposal because no data exists to support or refute the contention. If the PIs were correct, this would be an exciting opportunity. Good performance at moderate conditions would allow for the recovery of stranded or waste methane as liquid chemicals/fuels, which are far easier to handle, transport and utilize. This also is a GHG reducing strategy. The experimental program involves catalyst synthesis (not necessarily easy) of catalysts with various perfluoroalkyl groups and various metal ions, and then evaluation in straightforward laboratory equipment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plans are to use a mix of chemistry and chemical engineering students to carry out the work, including undergraduates. Under-represented students will be sought, and because the enrollment is predominantly non-white, this involvement is likely. This project will have appeal to a number of students, as it involves catalyst synthesis and seeks to solve an environmental problem.</AbstractNarration>
