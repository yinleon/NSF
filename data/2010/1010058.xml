    <AbstractNarration>Li&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1010058&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops a new (non-orthogonal) fusion&lt;br/&gt;frame, a notion of reflective sensing, and their applications. &lt;br/&gt;They are derived from the need for sparse fusion frame operators&lt;br/&gt;for efficient data fusion applications in general distributed&lt;br/&gt;systems. Theme 1 of the project defines a new non-orthogonal&lt;br/&gt;fusion frame. Preliminary studies show that the matrix&lt;br/&gt;representation of the new fusion frame operator can be diagonal&lt;br/&gt;over the same example where the existing fusion frame operator is&lt;br/&gt;completely sparse-less. Because the fusion operation ultimately&lt;br/&gt;involves the inverse of the fusion frame operator, and because&lt;br/&gt;subspace transformations are generally unavailable in practical&lt;br/&gt;data fusion applications, such a new fusion frame with sparse or&lt;br/&gt;diagonal fusion operator becomes crucial. Theme 2 studies a&lt;br/&gt;notion of multi-fusion frames based on multiple non-orthogonal&lt;br/&gt;projections onto one subspace. Nearly surprisingly, the new&lt;br/&gt;multi-fusion frame operator defined on one proper subspace can be&lt;br/&gt;easily positive and invertible. A number of theoretical issues&lt;br/&gt;are to be understood. Rooted in studies of themes 1 and 2, theme&lt;br/&gt;3 outlines a notion of reflective sensing and multiple reflective&lt;br/&gt;sensing. Their theory and applications in side-measured&lt;br/&gt;tomography and multi-path wireless signal receiving are examined. &lt;br/&gt;It is relevant to point out that the implementation of&lt;br/&gt;non-orthogonal projection operators is naturally achievable,&lt;br/&gt;based on earlier work by the investigator on pseudoframes for&lt;br/&gt;subspaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project relates to signal processing applications. &lt;br/&gt;Signal processing generally refers to making the signal easy to&lt;br/&gt;handle or of better quality. It is everywhere seen in our modern&lt;br/&gt;society. In this project, the principal novelties introduced to&lt;br/&gt;signal processing are the new notion of non-orthogonal fusion&lt;br/&gt;frames and ideas of performing data fusion from, e.g., wireless&lt;br/&gt;signals received from multiple paths. Fusion frame is a notion&lt;br/&gt;developed specifically for various data fusion applications. &lt;br/&gt;Data fusion means combining data measured by different devices or&lt;br/&gt;by different means in order to obtain refined data. The&lt;br/&gt;advantage of non-orthogonal fusion frames lies in the fact that&lt;br/&gt;they greatly improve efficiency of the data fusion procedure in&lt;br/&gt;practical sensor networks, particularly when the amount of data&lt;br/&gt;is large. The project aims to develop effective methods of&lt;br/&gt;combining data detected in an array of sensors where information&lt;br/&gt;overlay (among sensors) is abundant and unpredictable. With&lt;br/&gt;extremely complicated information overlaps, exact and efficient&lt;br/&gt;data combination is made possible by non-orthogonal fusion&lt;br/&gt;frames. In particular, the project explores image fusion to&lt;br/&gt;provide a combined image of much greater precision or resolution&lt;br/&gt;without ad-hoc procedures present in conventional techniques. &lt;br/&gt;Data fusion problems arise in many applications, ranging from&lt;br/&gt;commercial imaging to geographic survey, mapping, wireless&lt;br/&gt;communication, multi-sensor/camera surveillance systems, and a&lt;br/&gt;great number of sensor network applications.</AbstractNarration>
