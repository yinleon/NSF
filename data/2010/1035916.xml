    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop the theoretical foundations of robust &lt;br/&gt;cyber-physical systems. Robustness is the property ensuring that slight &lt;br/&gt;perturbations in the cyber, physical, or in the interaction between the cyber and &lt;br/&gt;the physical components, e.g., noise in sensor measurements, causes only slight &lt;br/&gt;changes in the system execution. While it is theoretically possible to enumerate &lt;br/&gt;all possible faults that can occur in a cyber-physical system and to design &lt;br/&gt;software components that correctly handle all such faults, the resulting &lt;br/&gt;specifications would be unwieldy and difficult to understand or verify. Instead, this &lt;br/&gt;project investigates the design of software components that guarantee &lt;br/&gt;robustness of cyber-physical systems with respect to unmodeled faults. The &lt;br/&gt;approach consist in abstracting and generalizing several key ideas from robust &lt;br/&gt;control theory to cyber-physical systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's intellectual merit is divided in two parts. The first part consists in &lt;br/&gt;defining a notion of robustness for cyber-physical systems relying on finite-state &lt;br/&gt;abstractions of the physical world retaining metric information about physical &lt;br/&gt;quantities. The second part consists in developing the methods and tools for &lt;br/&gt;automatically synthesizing software modules enforcing desired specifications in a &lt;br/&gt;robust manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tools and techniques developed in this project will significantly enhance our &lt;br/&gt;ability to produce robust cyber-physical systems and thus have a broad impact in &lt;br/&gt;several application areas transcending computer science and control &lt;br/&gt;engineering. Moreover, the broader impact of the proposed research is amplified &lt;br/&gt;by explicitly addressing the lack of robustness in legacy software through the &lt;br/&gt;development of robustifying software patches. To enhance the transfer of the &lt;br/&gt;research results to industry, the PIs and the Electrical Engineering Office of &lt;br/&gt;Industrial Relations will host a workshop for the local industry on robust cyber-&lt;br/&gt;physical systems.</AbstractNarration>
