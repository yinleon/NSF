    <AbstractNarration>An award was made to the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Salisbury Cove, Maine, to provide research training for 10 weeks for 10 undergraduates, for the summers of 2010-2015. This award is also supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) in the Directorate for Geosciences (GEO). The scientific focus of the MDIBL REU Site is marine molecular physiology and environmental stress. Of particular interest are marine and freshwater environments in which organisms are constantly exposed to changes in tide, salinity, temperature, pH, as well as both natural and human-made toxins. Using a variety of model organisms, students will investigate osmoregulation, acid base regulation, ion transport, functional genomics, and environmental toxicology using state-of-the-art technology. Key program elements are mentored laboratory research, weekly lectures and seminars, participation in science outreach to a public audience, student presentations of research to the MDIBL community, and training in responsible conduct in research. Students live on campus in close proximity to the research laboratories, conference center, and dining hall. Targeted students include rising sophomores and juniors majoring in biology or a related discipline such as biochemistry, environmental sciences, or science education. The MDIBL REU Site makes a special effort to recruit underrepresented minorities in science, as well as students from small colleges and other institutions lacking the research faculty or infrastructure necessary for a robust undergraduate research program. Interested students are asked to apply online, including: an Application Form, Short Answer/Essay Questions, two Faculty Recommendations, and a Transcript. Applications are reviewed, scored, and ranked by faculty committee. Applications are due in January, with offers made in February and March. Students will complete the REU common assessment tool at the end of their research fellowship and will be contacted in successive years to track their progress in science. For further information contact James B. Claiborne, Ph.D. (jb@georgiasouthern.edu), the Principal Investigator, at Georgia Southern University, or see http://www.mdibl.org/undergraduate_students.php .</AbstractNarration>
