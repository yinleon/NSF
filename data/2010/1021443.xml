    <AbstractNarration>The goals of this proposal are to transform how undergraduates learn biology, and to combat student disengagement from science by extending the use nationally of a pedagogical method known as CREATE (Consider, Read, Elucidate hypotheses, Analyze and interpret data, and Think of the next Experiment). This method brings about significant increases in both student understanding of, and student interest in biological research. The CREATE approach uses intensive analysis of papers published sequentially from single labs to show the evolution of research projects in real time. Through this method, students are taught how to dissect the papers into individual experiments, thus demystifying the process of reading scientific literature (journal articles) through the use of progressive pedagogical tools. By focusing on data analysis, experimental design and student grant panel activities, CREATE models the process of real science research in a way that is accessible and meaningful for student learning. In addition, CREATE students conduct informal (email) interviews with the authors of selected papers, thereby acquiring "behind the scenes" information that often humanizes the science as well as the scientists for the students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, equal numbers of faculty from community colleges and four-year institutions are being recruited for CREATE Intensive Workshops. Trained faculty will subsequently implement CREATE strategies at both types of institutions. Students of these faculty will be tracked using a variety of assessment tools. The workshops facilitate dialogue among faculty from these diverse educational settings, thus establishing "pipeline" relationships between community and senior colleges. This project is promoting collaborative interactions that ultimately benefit faculty and students at multiple levels of higher education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being co-funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
