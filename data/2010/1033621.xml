    <AbstractNarration>The overall goal of the proposed research is to use an enzyme ?terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)? to grow long single stranded (ss) DNA chains from a surface that incorporate a diverse range of unnatural ?chemically or optically functional nucleotides? in the growing DNA chain; we call this technology surface initiated enzymatic polymerization (SIEP) of DNA. The outcome of this research is that it will provide a new and versatile, on-chip signal detection and amplification scheme that is broadly applicable to on-chip sensors, heterogeneous immunoassays, protein and DNA microarrays, and for the detection of microRNA. To fulfill the goal of the proposed research, a systematic, mechanistic investigation and optimization of SIEP of linear and branched DNA structures will be carried out with a set of natural and unnatural nucleotides that embed chemically reactive nucleotides, or optically or electrochemically reactive detection moieties into the polymerized DNA chains. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the research is that it will yield rationally designed, DNA-based nanostructures that can be employed in versatile and multiplexed molecular detection schemes. The technically simple and experimentally convenient approaches for signal amplification developed herein will: (1) allow analysis of dilute or weakly binding samples and thus increase array sensitivity; (2) allow reduction of the feature size without sacrificing signal intensity, which would enable more information to be encoded on a single substrate; and (3) provide robust strategies for signal detection for point-of-care diagnostics. The proposed research is transformative because of its broad utility, as it will lead to the development of a novel and versatile detection and amplification platform technology that is broadly applicable to a broad range of on-chip sensors, heterogeneous immunoassays, protein and DNA microarrays, and for the emerging field of microRNA detection. The broader impact of this research in terms of education and outreach is that: (1) it will engage two PhD students, a Duke undergraduate student (through the Pratt fellows program) and a hearing-impaired student (through an existing REU program) to engage in team science; (2) it will target 4th-6th grade female students from Durham public schools through the FEMMES program at Duke University, by providing hands-on laboratory experiences to foster their excitement and understanding of science and engineering; (3) it will engage highly motivated, selected senior high school students in the project directly through the mentorship program of the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM) in Durham.</AbstractNarration>
