    <AbstractNarration>The Ecological Society of America is awarded a grant to convene a workshop, "Strategies for Sustainability of Biological Infrastructure" to bring together managers of a cross-section of infrastructure forms to begin developing strategies for sustainability. This workshop will begin a series of conversations aimed at providing guidance for funders, managers, and users of biological infrastructure to ensure long-term sustainability. Further, this beginning will have immediate utility in creating an environment for frank discussion of the issues involved and in locating both common ground and important differences in approach among the various infrastructure forms and projects represented. Such an effort is critical to the ultimate goal of integrating sustainability into infrastructure development on the part of both developers and funders. The workshop seeks to clearly define the problem, including: identifying types of operational costs associated with various infrastructure forms and how easily those costs can be separated from costs for improvement, development and training; describing metrics of success for infrastructure facilities; and identifying threats to the continued availability of such facilities. Workshop participants will also develop recommendations for structures for subsequent workshops, including issues to be addressed in various research communities, the roles of those involved in ongoing development projects, and the roles of infrastructure users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the workshop are associated with its contribution to the enhancement of research infrastructure. At present, multiple possible models exist that might ensure sustainability of different infrastructure forms. However, planning is fragmented and largely internal to specific projects, with the public conversation limited to brief discussions in various reports. This workshop seeks to bring this conversation to the fore, beginning with managers of infrastructure projects and then pointing the way toward subsequent discussions with and among developers and users. The goal is a strategy for developing solutions, enhancing the health of biological infrastructure and the long-term sustainability of the research enterprise.
