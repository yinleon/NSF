    <AbstractNarration>The Ecological Society of America will host an Ecology and Education Summit in the fall of 2010. It will bring together leaders of diverse national ecology and environmental education organizations and scientific societies, as well as organizations of teachers, technology experts, and the business sector, to disseminate best practices that will advance Environmental Literacy for a Sustainable World, reduce duplication of efforts, and coordinate strategies to build capacity and pathways of support for green careers for the next generation. In this effort, strategies to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities and women into the ecological and environmental agenda are of critical priority. By bringing the best in science, educational practice, and technology development to one event, the Summit aims to accelerate the transformation of teaching and learning among K-20+ audiences in both formal and informal settings in response to the urgent and complex environmental challenges faced today.</AbstractNarration>
