    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI focuses on the understanding of fundamental principles of directed assembly of novel highly branched nanostructures: (1) star block copolymers with responsive ionic blocks and (2) highly branched inorganic-organic nanostructures with multiple arm functionalities. Expanding a traditional set of characterization tools to neutron small angle scattering and neutron reflectivity will allow deeper understanding of the intra- and intermolecular organization of complex macromolecular assemblies at interfaces. The group will focus on morphology, microstructure, and conformation of fully organic and hybrid organic-inorganic branched nanostructures at different interfaces as a function of chemical composition, external conditions, and surface topology/functionalities: &lt;br/&gt;-- surface behavior of star block copolymers with emphasis on complex stars with ionic blocks with different molecular architectures on planar and templated surfaces with tailored functionalities and topography under different environmental conditions which vary conformation and composition of responsive ionic blocks;&lt;br/&gt;-- design and the formation of highly branched inorganic-organic polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane nanostructures with different branching and chemical composition of functionalized arms and their assembling behavior at tailored surfaces and interfaces;&lt;br/&gt;-- the understanding of surface behavior and spectral properties of novel "multispectral dots" as inorganic-organic nanostructures with low light scattering and absorption and their directed assembly into nanoengineered materials.&lt;br/&gt;The PI expects that these novel nanostructures assembled onto templated functionalized surfaces with the ability to guide their organization might possess potentially intriguing responsive and spectral properties critical for such fields as chemical sensing and flexible nanocomposites. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An impact of this project is anticipated in both advanced research and higher education. First, the fundamental understanding will be critical for further progress in applied research and developments of novel organized hybrid nanomaterials with unique physical (optical and surface) properties that are applicable in such diverse fields as energy conversion, colometric and chemical sensors. Second, advances in student education will be achieved through internationally-enhanced training with emphasis on early involvement in interdisciplinary collaboration with diverse academic and government research labs in US and Europe. Through this intense collaboration, the research will enable Ph.D. students to become mature scientists familiar with cutting-edge research in nanomaterials. &lt;br/&gt;The PI will continue his efforts to increase the number of students pursuing advanced degrees in science and engineering by actively working with the President's Undergraduate Research Award and Summer Undergraduate Research Programs at GT. The PI places continued emphasis on recruiting under-represented students. One of PI's minority graduate students will be involved as a mentor with GT Center for Education Integrating Science, Math, and Computing (CEISMC) working with minority middle/high school students in Atlanta Public School System helping to prepare minority students for college life.</AbstractNarration>
