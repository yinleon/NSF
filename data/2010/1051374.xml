    <AbstractNarration>This set of two inter-related workshops is designed to advance theorizing about human rights as well as identify and evaluate quantitative and qualitative indicators of human rights. It will identify promising lines of inquiry regarding how legal rights operate as resources, the actors involved in translating rights on the books into social practice, and the social mechanisms through which such translation occurs. These potential new research directions focus on the role of rights discourse and framing strategies in the rights' translation process, the role played by scientific and technical expertise in that process, and the operation of cause lawyering in relation to this same domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will also foster new collaborations among scholars -- anthropologists, economists, political scientists, sociologists, and legal scholars -- working in this shared intellectual area.</AbstractNarration>
