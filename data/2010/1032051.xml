    <AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation is providing partial funding for sponsorship of the Board on Behavioral, Cognitive and Sensory Sciences (BBCSS) at the National Academies of Science. This board, comprised of an impressive range of expertise with outstanding scholars as its members, facilitates the exchange of information and ideas on topical policy issues through meetings and workshops, and explores avenues (e.g. through planning meetings) that may lead to new and important studies. The Board offers high-quality analysis and sound scientific judgment to inform policy decisions and to guide research agendas in the diverse fields that are represented by the Board's mandate. It also brings together government decision makers with the world's most prominent scientists to elicit forward thinking about potentially significant scientific developments and policy issues. It also collaborates with other Boards and Divisions within the National Academies such as the Institute of Medicine and the Division of Earth and Life Sciences. The work of the Board and of its committees is subject to the Academies' high scientific standards for rigor, excellence, and peer review. Sponsorship of BBCSS will also support the retention of experienced staff who can be responsive to requests and opportunities as they arise to enhance the ability of the BBCSS to meet its mission and fulfill its responsibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of the Board's work in advancing behavioral science research can be seen in the research agendas of multiple Federal agencies that fund such research. The Board influences public policy in a variety of areas such as national security (helping intelligence analysts with decision-making tools), human capital (contributions to education and learning), and human interactions with technological advances. Importantly, the imprimatur of the National Academies ensures attention to the products and activities of the Board on Behavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
