    <AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).&lt;br/&gt;Recent events highlight the need for a paradigm shift to look holistically at the nation's infrastructure throughout its life, from the planning stages through design, construction, operation, maintenance, and rehabilitation. The Hurricane Katrina disaster, the general deterioration of the nation's infrastructure, and the need for renewable energy sources are just a few examples highlighting this need for new thinking. The objective of this Science Masters Program (SMP) is to link engineering, materials, construction, environment, architecture, business, and public policy to produce graduates with unique holistic perspective and expertise to immediately contribute to the workforce in the area of sustainable and resilient infrastructure. Through extensive interaction with external partners and project team members, SMP students will participate in research on topics that are at the cutting edge, work in interdisciplinary teams, experience how the business world functions, and enhance their skills to communicate sustainability and resiliency ideas to technical and non-technical audiences. Each SMP-supported student will be required to complete a research thesis. External partners are from a broad cross section of the national economy including national government labs, international and national engineering firms, state and local government agencies, and non-profit and professional organizations. The project team members are committed to include student participants from underrepresented groups in engineering and science. This SMP is supporting 14 full-time students that are citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. in two cohorts of 7 students each. Each student receives a stipend support and has a tuition waiver for 18 months. Graduates of this program will fill workforce needs in areas of national economic growth that ensures a safe and sustainable infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
