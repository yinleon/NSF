    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support to defray expenses of participants in a week-long summer symposium on recent advances in real analysis at The College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio from July 13 -17, 2010. This is the 34th Summer Symposium in Real Analysis. Much of the funding will be directed to the goal of disseminating knowledge to and inclusion of underrepresented minorities and women mathematicians. In addition to this clear goal of dissemination of knowledge, this conference has the broader goal to provide a nurturing environment for young researchers and to be an exemplar of an exciting research community to the students of The College of Wooster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past dozen years there has been a resurgence of vibrant research in the area of real analysis, coupled with greater international correspondence. The Summer Symposium, which throughout its existence attracted a large international audience, will play a central role in future developments. The Symposium will offer researchers the opportunity to hear and share the newest findings in the field of real analysis.</AbstractNarration>
