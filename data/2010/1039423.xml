    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award to Dartmouth College funds the acquisition of a confocal microscope with a hybrid scanner, spectral unmixing and components that allow for Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) and Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) measurements. This system will significantly advance basic science research and teaching infrastructure at Dartmouth and throughout New Hampshire and Vermont. The research enabled by the new system addresses fundamental questions in cell biology and developmental biology, and utilizes a diverse array of model systems (bacteria, fungi, algae, plants, worms, flies and mice). In all cases, the new confocal system will substantially improve and expand the imaging capabilities and allow Dartmouth investigators to continue to conduct leading-edge research and to train the next generation of life scientists. Each of the faculty using the new microscope is committed to teaching science at all levels and to preparing successful future scientists and science teachers. The new system makes state-of-the-art imaging technology more accessible to undergraduate students, graduate students and post-doctoral scholars, as well as students and teachers in our local secondary schools. Furthermore, Dartmouth faculty members have an extensive history of including undergraduate interns in their research programs and incorporating the latest scientific approaches and data into their courses. The results of these research and teaching efforts will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>
