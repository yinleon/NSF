    <AbstractNarration>I-C STEM In My FUTURE is a two-year, year-round, informal learning program for 80 students focusing on mathematics, the use of hand-held technology, computer literacy skills, technical training and career paths. The project will examine the impact of this technology-enriched intervention program on the STEM career interest of underrepresented minorities. It is an ITEST strategies proposal designed to provide middle and high school students with challenging technological learning experiences that will foster STEM career choices, promote academic success in high school, and prepare students academically to attend a college or university. The project proposes to provide interdisciplinary exposure to concepts in computer science and mathematics. The goal of the project is to allow students to gain experience in critical thinking, to reinforce an understanding of topics discussed through hands-on activities, and to ignite an interest in STEM that will ultimately lead to pursuit of STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will explore the influence of applications of mathematics, engineering, and technology on student interest in college, high school STEM courses, and STEM careers. The project activities will consist of Saturday sessions during the school year, tutoring sessions with college mentors and a two-week residential summer camp. Programmatic activities are provided for both students and parents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project outcomes will determine which strategies are most effective in encouraging 80 middle and high school students to prepare for STEM career. A database will be used to track information on students as they progress through the program. The project will seek to answer the following questions: (1) Do informal hands-on scientific algebra and geometry experiments combined with technology enriched activities encourage middle school students to take STEM courses in high school? (2) Does technology training and exploration promote the pursuit of STEM careers by underrepresented minorities in middle and high school? (3)Does academic support through one-on-one tutoring promote academic success in STEM courses and in STEM career choices among underrepresented minorities? (4) Does academic support through mentoring increase the self-efficacy in the academic pursuit of underrepresented minorities in STEM courses and career choices?</AbstractNarration>
