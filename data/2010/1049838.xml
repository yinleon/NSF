    <AbstractNarration>This is a Rapid Response Research (RAPID) proposal to study the effects of oiling as a catastrophic disturbance on coastal elevation, as related to the biotic contributions of peat material. In response to the BP Deepwater Horizon oil-spill, the PIs will test the hypotheses that i) oiling, or hydrologic remediation designed to prevent oiling, will cause reductions in above- and below-ground production and peat accumulation, increases in soil respiration and decomposition rates, and ultimately result in net losses in elevation of baldcypress swamps, and ii) that the resilience of these habitats, with regard to these ecosystem processes, will be lower in oiled swamps than in undisturbed areas. The investigators will make use of historically-relevant data on above- and belowground production, tree growth, decomposition, and regeneration from previous long-term studies in coastal baldcypress swamps in Jean Lafitte National Park and other sites. Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane emissions from the wetlands will be measured, in anticipation that decomposition and other biogeochemical processes may shift in response to the disturbance. These sites were targeted for long-term studies because they are sensitive to changes in elevation as a result of high rates of sea level rise experienced throughout the region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These data will permit an assessment of both the direct and indirect impacts of oil spills and the proactive efforts made to reduce oiling on ecosystem processes in coastal freshwater swamp ecosystems that are found along the entire Gulf and Southeast Atlantic coasts. The research will provide managers and the public with information on the effects of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill and its hydrologic remediation on coastal wetland elevation, and will be disseminated via peer reviewed journal articles and briefs written for the public. An undergraduate student will be trained as part of the research.</AbstractNarration>
