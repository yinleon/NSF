    <AbstractNarration>The potential power of quantum computers is of enormous interest and consequence. Quantum complexity theory has identified the problem class QMA-complete. QMA (Quantum Merlin Arthur) is a set of decision problems, i.e. the answer is either "YES" or "NO", such that if the answer is "YES", there exists a polynomial size quantum state (Merlin) that convinces a polynomial time quantum verifier (Arthur) of the answer "YES" with high probability (=2/3). Also, if the answer is "NO", any polynomial size quantum state is rejected by the verifier with high probability. This QMA-complete class is believed to be too hard even for quantum computers to solve efficiently in every possible case, i.e. in a time that grows only polynomially in the size of the input problem. The study of the corresponding hard problems, e.g. SAT, in standard classical computation has benefitted from the investigation of typical cases using techniques from statistical physics. SAT (SATisfiability) is the problem of determining if the variables of a formula F can be assigned in such a way that F evaluates to value 1. This has led to insights into the organization of their solution spaces and new algorithms for solving them. This strategy will serve as inspiration for generating quantum statistical mechanical insights into quantum computational challenges---by focusing on typical instances of QMA-complete problems. The primary effort will focus on the so-called quantum satisfiability (QSAT) problem, where work will range from locating phase transitions and understanding their implications to constructing new algorithms based on this understanding. Extensions of the methodology to other QMA-complete problems (e.g. k-local Hamiltonian or density matrix consistency) will also be considered. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research will lie principally in the training of a postdoctoral fellow who will take part in this work and in the exposure of undergraduates to ideas in this field as part of their standard research experience at the PI's home institution. As quantum information and computation is a relatively young field with much promise, such training and exposure will have a substantial impact on its trajectory.</AbstractNarration>
