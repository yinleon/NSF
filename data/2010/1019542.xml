    <AbstractNarration>This R&amp;D study integrates American Sign Language (ASL) into the life and physical sciences content of 9th-12th grade deaf or hard-of-hearing students. TERC and Vcom3D incorporate the use of the Signing Avatar assistive technology in order to develop, research, and disseminate two illustrated interactive 3D dictionaries: Signing Life Science Dictionary (SLSD), and Signing Physical Science Dictionary (SPSD) with audio modes and approximately 750 standards-based terms in English and Spanish text that can be signed or listened to on demand. Two research questions guide the study: (1) What kinds of learning gains in life science are possible with the use of the SLSD?; and (2) What kinds of learning gains in physical science are possible with the use of the SPSD? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposers hypothesize that the use of both SLSD and SPSD will assist participants to increase their ability to sign, understand, and use the languages of life and physical sciences; improve their science content knowledge; and increase their ability to study each content area independently. The development phase of the study defines a nine-step plan for each dictionary: (1) developing English-based text components (signed terms, parts of speech, definitions, and examples); (2) integrating illustrations; (3) developing Spanish-based text components; (4) integrating narration; (5) refining the interface; (6) incorporating support materials; (7) testing; (8) evaluating project progress; and (9) disseminating results. The research phase employs a mixed-methods pretest-posttest, within-subjects research design. Each subject is tested in the experimental condition (with the dictionaries) and in the control condition (without the dictionaries). To determine the sample size, the G*Power software was used assuming a type I error of 0.05, a power of 0.80, and an effect size of 0.25 (based on previous work). A sample size of 100 was identified, but researchers increased it to 150 to address teacher attrition. Data gathering instruments include pretests and posttests focused on the appropriate use of the science vocabulary, content questionnaires, scoring criteria and rubrics, classroom observation and interview protocols, and post-use surveys. Quantitative data strategies include analysis of trends in pre-post learning within and between groups, such as change in vocabulary knowledge, content knowledge, and independence using procedures, such as paired t-test and ANOVA. Qualitative data analysis employs categorizing and synthesizing data, such as narrative analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The final outcome of this study is a completed suite of research-informed and field-tested technology-enhanced tools to assist high school deaf and hard-of-hearing students to improve their life, physical, and earth sciences learning.</AbstractNarration>
