    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Measurement and Imaging program (CMI) of the Division of Chemistry supports Professor Richard P. Van Duyne and his group at Northwestern University to develop new instrumentation and concepts for fast, parallel biosensing. The long-term aim is to enable many new experiments such as (1) real-time 3D nanoparticle tracking in low viscosity media to study nanoparticle growth dynamics; (2) extending the biosensor sensitivity to the single molecule limit; (3) developing multiplexed biosensors utilizing single nanoparticles; (4) measuring the internal fluctuational dynamics of nanoparticle assemblies constructed with molecular linkers; and (5) intracellular biosensing. The instrumentation developed will lead to fundamentally new understanding of the chemistry of single molecules (or small clusters) adsorbed onto single nanoparticles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has potential for broad impact on: (1) nanoscale science &amp; technology in general and plasmonics in particular; (2) the education of graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, undergraduates, and secondary school teachers; (3) the training of women and minority scientists for careers in industry and academia; and (4) the dissemination of information about nanoscale science &amp; technology to broad audiences. Substantial scientific and societal impact will derive from applications such as new plasmonic sensors for in vivo glucose monitoring, clinical diagnostics for Alzheimer?s disease, chemical/biological warfare agent detection, and art conservation studies. Students and postdocs working on this project will receive extensive training in mechanical and electronics construction as well as instrument control programming. As a consequence they will have the tool set needed to become independent and innovative research leaders in chemical measurement science.</AbstractNarration>
