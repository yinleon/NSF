    <AbstractNarration>SES-1024271&lt;br/&gt;PI: Rebecca J. Erickson&lt;br/&gt;Institution: The University of Akron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: James M. Diefendorff&lt;br/&gt;Institution: The University of Akron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates identity and emotion management control theories to examine how the occupational context combines with self processes to affect individual and organizational outcomes. The researchers use a mixed methods design with a sample of registered nurses in seven acute care hospitals in the Midwestern United States. Data are collected through questionnaires, organizational records, audio recordings, and face-to-face interviews. By cross-validating the findings from the different data sources, the researchers will be able to empirically specify how social contexts, interactional events, and the emotions which emerge from them, are experienced and managed in ways that impact key dimensions of individual health. It will also provide insights into work unit-level effectiveness of nursing care provided within hospital settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;As demands for nursing care continue to increase, understanding determinants of nurse well-being, and how this relates to patient well-being, has become a growing concern for health care organizations. This project has the potential to translate theoretically-informed results into organizational policies and practices that promote the well-being of both patients and the nurses who care for them.</AbstractNarration>
