    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for Dr. Ben Cuker at Hampton University and Dr. Roger Levine of American Institutes for Research (AIR) to evaluate results of the American Society of Limnology and Oceanograhy Minority Program (ASLOMP), a program designed to increase the numbers of under-represented minorities electing careers in aquatic sciences. The program targets minority students, faculty and professionals interested in aquatic sciences, as well as faculty working at Historically Minority Colleges and Universities (HMCU). Participants received a free membership in ASLO and support to attend the annual meetings and special pre-meeting workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although results of the ASLOMP program are reported annually, this evaluation will focus on outcomes of the program over a 20 year period. Data collected by Dr. Cuker in 2010 indicates that between 1990 and 2009 there have been 1,109 student participations, comprised of 704 different students (the difference being made up by students who participated in more than one meeting). Typically 65 students participated each year. Some 80% of the students first entered the program as undergraduates, with many returning as graduate students. Overall, 232 students participated at the graduate level and 546 as undergraduates. Over the course of the program females comprised 65% of the participants but in recent years over 80%. While informal and antidotal data suggest that the program produced many excellent participants that have gone on for advanced studies and careers in the aquatic or related sciences, it is important to determine its overall effectiveness. The longevity of the ASLOMP presents a unique opportunity to gauge its impact on the diversity of the aquatic science community. Such a study will also point to those aspects of the program that appear most important in retaining and advancing the participants in the field. Its findings will also inform others interested in advancing diversity in the sciences in general.</AbstractNarration>
