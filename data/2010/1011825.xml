    <AbstractNarration>Richard Saykally of the University of California, Berkeley is supported by an award from the Chemical Structures, Dynamics and Mechanisms program in the Chemistry Division to further develop and extend his high precision Terahertz vibration-rotation-tunneling (VRT) spectroscopy measurements of small water clusters. Results from these measurements are being used to calibrate and test new theoretical approaches in order to achieve the goal of a "universal first-principles" model of water. Professor Saykally and his research group focus on the complete characterization of the isotopomers of dimer-hexamer water clusters to develop and validate theoretical descriptions of the complicated man-body interactions that are important for water in the condensed phases. They are also extending these approaches to treat larger later clusters, protonated water clusters, and clusters of water with nitrogen oxygen and hydrocarbons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because water is such a ubiquitous substance on our planet as well as crucial for the existence of life, it is important to understand its intrinsic nature as well as its interaction with other substances. An accurate model of water is crucial for proper calculation of many biological structures and functions, as well as for understanding critical environmental issue such as global warming. While great advances have been made in developing these models, they are still not accurate enough for many important applications. The PI actively reaches out to increase the public understanding of the nature of water through public lectures, the media and other venues. Undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, including many women, take part in this research program.</AbstractNarration>
