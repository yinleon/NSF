    <AbstractNarration>Evolutionary relationships among fossil plesiadapiforms (putative early primates) and other closely related mammals (primates, treeshrews, and flying lemurs) have been debated for decades. Several recent analyses suggest that plesiadapiforms are most closely related to primates of modern aspect, and are therefore critical for testing hypotheses regarding the origin and earliest evolutionary history of primates. The aim of this project is to clarify which anatomical features separate primates from other mammals, and to elucidate the order in which certain modern primate features evolved following the divergence from non-primate mammals. This project will analyze the paleobiology and systematics of the Micromomyidae; the most primitive family of plesiadapiforms for which postcrania are known. Functional analyses of all known micromomyid fossil material, including four undescribed skeletons, will be interpreted in the context of a new phylogenetic tree. Modern methods in phylogenetic systematics will be utilized, including combined morphological and molecular analyses, and Bayesian methods for morphological data. Although these techniques are gaining popularity in other areas of evolutionary biology, they have not yet been used to assess relationships among primates and their close relatives. Innovative methods integrating micro CT scans will be used to quantitatively compare micromomyid skeletons to those of closely related mammals, and to reconstruct the diversity of positional behaviors and grasping abilities of the most primitive primates. Micro CT scans will also be used to quantify tooth crown dimensions, and determine the dietary habits of primitive primates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will promote a better understanding of the first clear step in the divergence of humans from other mammals. Undergraduate students will be trained in all areas of data collection, and all data will be uploaded to online digital archives. Outreach includes the proposal of an exhibit on primate origins at the Yale Peabody Museum, as well as lectures at local high schools.</AbstractNarration>
