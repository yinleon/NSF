    <AbstractNarration>The productivity of modern land plants is coupled to the structure and function of the plant vascular system. Specifically, it is the xylem tissue that determines the efficiency of water transport in higher plants. A great deal is known about the structure-function trade-offs that limit water transport in woody taxa, and yet very little work has examined the vascular performance of their relatives, the ferns. Like conifer wood, fern xylem is primarily comprised of single-celled, hollow conduits, but it is distinguished by the absence of wood and other key anatomical features that promote transport efficiency in conifers. What are the hydraulic and photosynthetic limitations imposed by this primitive type of primary xylem, and how can it inform our understanding of the evolution of vascular tissue? The goal of this project is to examine the structure and function of fern xylem using hydraulic, chemical and anatomical methods, across the fern evolutionary tree. These data will provide us with a deeper understanding of the evolution of plant vascular function, and will be used to model water transport in Archaeopteris, a Devonian conifer-fern hybrid representing the first modern tree. A second, long-term effort will monitor the morphology and physiology of local fern species in the redwood forest understory along a precipitation gradient spanning northern to central California. Fern frond size is directly related to water availability, and can serve as a convenient indicator of understory vegetation response in response to changes in precipitation. This field-based project aims to increase the participation of under-represented undergraduates in the natural sciences, inform students about climate change and build a long-term database of understory community structure in coastal California.</AbstractNarration>
