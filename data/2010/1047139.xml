    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is directed towards the&lt;br/&gt;development of new materials that can serve in several functions, all of which are important in&lt;br/&gt;reducing the environmental impact of the use of energy. The proposed materials will be solids&lt;br/&gt;capable of removing one gas (such as carbon dioxide) from a mixture of gases (such as air), and&lt;br/&gt;then releasing the captured gas at the desired time. To be successful, the materials must be able&lt;br/&gt;to hold a large amount of captured gas and be capable of undergoing a minimum of 10,000&lt;br/&gt;capture/release cycles required for a year of operation. The Phase I effort will focus on the use of&lt;br/&gt;the materials in a process that uses bromine to convert biogas into renewable transportation fuels,&lt;br/&gt;such as bio-gasoline. Additional applications of the materials, such as removing carbon dioxide&lt;br/&gt;and other contaminants from gases will be examined in Phase II of the project.&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are the demands for cleaner transportation&lt;br/&gt;fuels and electric power. Despite the tremendous drive to move to renewable transportation&lt;br/&gt;fuels, the production costs of renewable fuels remains too high to be competitive with fossil&lt;br/&gt;fuels. If successful, the research proposed in the Phase I project will make the production of&lt;br/&gt;renewable transportation fuels significantly more cost effective. Additionally, the proposed&lt;br/&gt;materials would also have utility in the electric power industry, where there is a growing need to&lt;br/&gt;capture carbon dioxide and remove sulfur oxides from flue gas.</AbstractNarration>
