    <AbstractNarration>The 2010 IEEE INFOCOM Conference on Computer Communications will be held in San Diego, CA from March 15 to March 19, 2010. This flagship technical conference is a premier venue in the area of computer communications, and is widely attended by researchers and practitioners in the field. This project provides funds to support approximately twenty-one graduate and post-graduate students in the United States to attend INFOCOM 2010 and to present their work. Participating students will also have the opportunity to attend several technical activities, including paper presentations, workshops, tutorials and panel/keynote sessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposal resides in encouraging and supporting student attendance to INFOCOM 2010. This continues the tradition of previous INFOCOM conferences as a premier venue for bringing together academia, industry, and government to share newest developments. Its rich program exposes participants to new ideas and cutting-edge research and allows for interaction between researchers from all over the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader Impact, the project integrates research and education through exposure of students to one of the premier conferences in computer communications. Students have the opportunity to attend high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers as well as peers in the field. This experience is expected to have a positive impact on the students? development as well as in shaping the future of the field. The project also promotes diversity by encouraging and enabling the participation of women, graduate students from under-represented minorities and institutions, and, for the first time, postdoctoral students as well.</AbstractNarration>
