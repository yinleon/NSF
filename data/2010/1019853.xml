    <AbstractNarration>In the last decade, computational mineral physics has played a fundamental role in our understanding of the Earth. It has complemented experiments by expanding the range of thermodynamics conditions materials properties can be investigated and has provided new insights into the nature of Earth's interior based on atomic scale arguments. This project supports a continuation of studies that use first principles calculations to quantify fundamental chemical and physical properties of some common minerals present deep in the interior of the Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this grant it is proposed to expand first principles studies of Earth's materials to i) include anharmonic effects on calculations of thermal properties and phase relations of minerals using methods recently developed by the team; ii) advance studies of phase transformations in solid solutions, particularly for the post-perovskite transition; iii) explore the rheological consequences of the spin-state crossover in ferropericlase, the second most important phase in the lower mantle; iv) couple these studies with geodynamical modeling of the mantle. These studies will make key contributions to our understanding of i) thermodynamic equilibrium in multi-phase aggregates; ii) properties of thermodynamics phase boundaries of major mantle minerals. There are still large uncertainties associated with measurements of Clapeyron slopes, discontinuities, and two-phase loops in divariant systems. These quantities control mantle dynamics and will be better constrained; iii) the rheology of ferropericlase has been implicated in the proposed viscosity minimum around 1,600 km depth and will now be investigated; iv) the geodynamical sensitivity to and consequences of these results. This research, which has intrinsic interdisciplinary value, will shed light on the nature and dynamics in the D" and mid-lower mantle regions.</AbstractNarration>
