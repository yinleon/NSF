    <AbstractNarration>1038691&lt;br/&gt;Vahsen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the investigation of a new approach to fast neutron detection that utilizes two new detector technologies that the PIs have experience with from experimental particle physics; Gas Electron Multipliers and Silicon Pixel Electronics. These technologies should result in much improved time and position resolution in the readout of gas-filled detectors, so that high rates (up to ~1 MHz/cm2) of both neutrons and charged particles (which may result in false neutron signals) can be measured with much greater precision, and with a lower energy threshold, than with traditional approaches. This is expected to translate into improved ability to locate and identify SNM, as well as significantly reduced rate of false SNM alarms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides good opportunity for the graduate students and postdoc to obtain training in detector development and characterization. The Postdoc Mentoring Plan is well-organized and appropriate. A scaled up system, if technically feasible, would be very attractive to the DNDO mission.</AbstractNarration>
