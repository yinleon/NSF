    <AbstractNarration>SES-1030788&lt;br/&gt;Linda Burton&lt;br/&gt;Victor Ray&lt;br/&gt;Duke University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using original qualitative data this dissertation will examine racial and gender differences in patterns of reintegration for veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Taking the post- service transition into civilian life as the unit of analysis, this work uses primary data to analyze how race and gender may structure the transition from military service. Prior research in the life course tradition has identified the transition from military service to civilian life as a key ?turning point? in the lives of disadvantaged men. This research will integrate and expand upon life course approaches with theoretical insights from ?racialized social system? and ?intersectional? frameworks to explore the possibility that life course transitions vary by racial and gender statuses. In order to accomplish theses goals data collection will focus on three primary research questions. 1. Are all military benefits created equal? That is, do post-service socio-economic outcomes for women and minorities parallel those of their white counterparts? 2. Is the experience of reintegration color qualitatively different for women and people of than it is for white male veterans? If so, what does this add to our understanding of ?turning points? over the life course? 3. How do institutions, such as the Veteran?s Administration, facilitate reintegration for particular issues facing women and people of color? Data will be derived from two primary sources, 50 in-depth interviews with recently returned veterans and a nine-month ethnographic investigation at a veteran?s center. The research will provide a clearer understanding of veterans? reintegration strategies and the ways in which these strategies are possibly shaped by racial and gender stratification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The study offers a major theoretical contribution to studies of the life course by incorporating cutting-edge racial and gender theories of stratification. The research provides a qualitative account of the post-service transition to civilian life in general, and insights into the racial and gender complexities of reintegration. Further, findings from this work may inform service providers on strategies to meet the needs of diverse veterans. Also as the first study of its kind, this work will provide a methodological and theoretical model that essential for understanding the complex process of reintegration.</AbstractNarration>
