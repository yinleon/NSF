    <AbstractNarration>Data centers have become the main networking infrastructure to&lt;br/&gt;support online services, ranging from end-user applications (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;Web search and IM) to distributed system operations (e.g., GFS and&lt;br/&gt;MapReduce). In this project, we explore a different design paradigm&lt;br/&gt;to data center networks (DCNs). We take a new server-centric&lt;br/&gt;solution approach, in contrast to the switch-centered paradigm. We&lt;br/&gt;push intelligence into servers, which generally have more open and&lt;br/&gt;standardized hardware architecture and software platforms. Multiple&lt;br/&gt;layers of low-cost, commodity off-the-shelf, mini-switches are used&lt;br/&gt;to connect servers. We leverage the large number of servers in a&lt;br/&gt;data center. Even when each server just adds one more link to the&lt;br/&gt;rest of servers, we obtain many links in the DCN system given the&lt;br/&gt;large server population. These added links, without using high-end&lt;br/&gt;switches but using only mini-switches, provide the foundation for&lt;br/&gt;enhancing scalability, inter-server capacity, and fault tolerance.&lt;br/&gt;Taking the approach, we can design DCNs with high scalability,&lt;br/&gt;enhanced fault-tolerance, and high inter-server capacity, and better&lt;br/&gt;support data center applications that exhibit various traffic&lt;br/&gt;patterns of one-to-one, one-to-several, one-to-all, and all-to-all&lt;br/&gt;communications. Our design also opens more space for stimulating&lt;br/&gt;innovations in the DCN software through the more open programming&lt;br/&gt;platform on servers, while abandoning expensive, proprietary core&lt;br/&gt;switches. The results in scalable and modular data centers and&lt;br/&gt;associated management tools are expected to show that, the added&lt;br/&gt;complexity into servers will incur only minor systems overhead but&lt;br/&gt;produce large performance gains.</AbstractNarration>
