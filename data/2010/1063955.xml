    <AbstractNarration>1063955 &lt;br/&gt; Shah, University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summary of Proposal: This project is for support for 12 US participants, including professors and students -to a workshop on Environmental Nanotechnology and Ethics to be held in Lahore, Pakistan on March 28-31, 2011. The workshop is part of longer collaborative activities on nanotechnology research and education supported by the U.S. and Pakistan, and it has a new dimension related to environmental and societal implications of nanotechnology, in addition to synthesis of nanomaterials. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The workshop deal with environmental and ethical issues associated with the emergence of science and engineering at the nanoscale. This topic provides a unique perspective that is not fully addressed at many existing conferences. The meeting will provide exchange of information, contribute to developing personal connections, and will contribute to strengthening scientific and engineering research. The PI has already sought/obtained local financial support in addition to this NSF funding for the travel of US participants. Preference in travel support will be given to those who have not traveled to Pakistan before. The planned technical programming and slate of invited speakers are strong. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The workshop is designed to introduce emerging topics in environmental nanotechnology and ethics to a scientific community within Pakistan and nearby regions. Ten US students are expected t attend this workshop. The workshop provides a unique forum to stimulate collaborations between US and Pakistan in the areas of environmental and ethical issues associated with nanotechnology. The US participation in the workshop is important considering the value of exchanges with Pakistan and neighboring countries, recognizing the increased level of funding and overall research for nanotechnology in Pakistan, and the potential of the workshop to address new topics on environmental and societal implications.</AbstractNarration>
