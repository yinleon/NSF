    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims at developing laser&lt;br/&gt;photoacoustic spectroscopy (LPAS) sensor for continuous, real-time measurements of&lt;br/&gt;hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), and other air pollutants such as Carbon monoxide, nitrogen&lt;br/&gt;oxides, and sulfur dioxide. The intellectual merit of the activity lies in the creation of a new a&lt;br/&gt;operationally simple, low cost, robust, compact, ruggedized field-deployable and affordable&lt;br/&gt;ambient air and stationary source pollution sensor that is capable of real-time measuring&lt;br/&gt;multiple pollutant and toxic compounds simultaneously. The instrument will use the newly&lt;br/&gt;advanced quantum cascade laser (QCL) or interband cascade laser (ICL) absorption to&lt;br/&gt;accurately quantify multiple chemical compounds within a short period of time (~ 40 to 60&lt;br/&gt;seconds) with a precision of sub parts per billion.&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this research are expected to be within numerous areas&lt;br/&gt;including: 1) Air toxic measurements, such as ambient air and stationary source pollution&lt;br/&gt;monitoring, industrial hygiene monitoring, confined space monitoring and process emission&lt;br/&gt;monitoring, etc. 2) Global atmospheric monitoring of air toxics, air pollutants, greenhouse gases,&lt;br/&gt;and trace species. 3) Military applications. Besides the environmental and industrial application,&lt;br/&gt;many other military applications including detection of Chemical Warfare Agent (CWA),&lt;br/&gt;explosives, TICs, can make use of the devices developed in this project. Potential customers&lt;br/&gt;include the EPA, NOAA or NASA for environmental monitoring, DoD for detection of IED&lt;br/&gt;(JIEDDO), the DHS for detection of explosives and scanning of luggage (TSA), etc.</AbstractNarration>
