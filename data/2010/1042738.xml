    <AbstractNarration>The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Visualization in Science and Education is a premier meeting for active researchers from a variety of disciplines including scientific visualization, use of visualization in education, visualization design, virtual reality, cognitive research, etc. The conference provides a framework to exchange ideas and build a broadening community around a crucial cross-and trans-disciplinary field that supports scientific research and science education. This three-phase project builds on the previous meetings and activities of the interdisciplinary community of the Gordon Research Conference on Visualization in Science and Education, dating back to 1994. Phase 1 includes three pre-conference workshops (on Design Principles for the New Media, Assessing Visualizations: Design &amp; Effectiveness, and Forging Creative Communities with Web-based Tools) and a new interactive Sci-Viz website informs and engages past and potential future members of the community with information on the pre-workshops and the conference itself, and serves as an organizing tool for dissemination and the design of the 2013 conference. Phase 2 (the conference itself) follows traditional GRC format and is held at Bryant University in July 2011 (see http://bit.ly/grc-viz-2011). Phase 3 includes collaborative efforts supported via mini-grants, post-conference activities which include a meeting to produce a follow-up report on results and lessons learned from the 8 meetings of the Visualization GRC conference series plus follow-up online activities that involve the wider community in ongoing revisions of the report as well as contributing shared resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the conference and its associated activities are to strengthen the professional interdisciplinary community around science visualization. Interactive community website (http://taxane.chem.unb.ca/GRC-SciViz) will provide information on the series of activities and include a report outlining future research directions and collaborative activities.</AbstractNarration>
