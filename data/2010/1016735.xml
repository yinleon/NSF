    <AbstractNarration>Current AI systems still lack the knowledge and reasoning &lt;br/&gt;abilities needed to handle the semantic subtleties of language &lt;br/&gt;and the thematic breadth of human discourse and thinking.&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a basic repertoire of lexical and&lt;br/&gt;other general knowledge for use in a powerful inference engine &lt;br/&gt;(EPILOG) designed expressly to support unrestricted language &lt;br/&gt;understanding and reasoning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methods being employed exploit the insights into language-based&lt;br/&gt;inference gained in recent years in the area of "natural Logic",&lt;br/&gt;which makes systematic use of word-level and structural entailment&lt;br/&gt;properties of language. These are easily modeled in EPILOG, which&lt;br/&gt;uses a language-like meaning representation (Episodic Logic). Some&lt;br/&gt;very general semantic properties are being manually encoded, and in &lt;br/&gt;addition, large numbers of knowledge items are being extracted&lt;br/&gt;computationally from lexical resources such as WordNet and VerbNet,&lt;br/&gt;and from word similarity or paraphrase clusters derived from large &lt;br/&gt;text corpora.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected result is a knowledge base of fundamental lexical and&lt;br/&gt;other commonsense knowledge that will allow demonstration of many&lt;br/&gt;previously infeasible language-based inferences, including both &lt;br/&gt;forward and backward reasoning and many multi-premise entailment &lt;br/&gt;inferences in existing test suites. This will significantly &lt;br/&gt;advance the state of the art in basic language understanding and &lt;br/&gt;in mechanizing "obvious inferences", with potential applications &lt;br/&gt;to intelligent dialogue-based agents (for question answering, &lt;br/&gt;tutoring, personal assistance, etc.), and to knowledge bootstrapping &lt;br/&gt;through machine reading. The results will be disseminated both &lt;br/&gt;through papers at conferences and in journals, and through web sites &lt;br/&gt;making available EPILOG and the newly developed knowledge bases.</AbstractNarration>
