    <AbstractNarration>Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been successfully applied to automatic &lt;br/&gt;speech recognition for more than 35 years even though a key HMM &lt;br/&gt;assumption - the statistical independence of frames - is obviously &lt;br/&gt;violated by speech data. In fact, this data/model mismatch has inspired &lt;br/&gt;many attempts to modify or replace HMMs with alternative models that are &lt;br/&gt;better able to take into account the statistical dependence of frames. &lt;br/&gt;The scientific goal of this work is to discover predictable regions of &lt;br/&gt;statistical dependence in speech data and quantify their effect on &lt;br/&gt;HMM-based recognition accuracy. In contrast to previous studies of &lt;br/&gt;statistical dependency, this research uses the HMM to explore its &lt;br/&gt;departure from the data via exploratory data analysis (EDA). The &lt;br/&gt;methodology is to first analyze the data and its fit to the model, &lt;br/&gt;searching for regions of predictable statistical dependence - model/data &lt;br/&gt;mismatch. EDA is used again to develop simple models of the effect of &lt;br/&gt;the predictable mismatch on recognition accuracy. A key piece of this &lt;br/&gt;analysis is the development and use of graphical tools to visualize the &lt;br/&gt;statistical dependency, the recognition errors, and their relationship. &lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will provide important clues for the design &lt;br/&gt;of HMM generalizations. The analysis methodology is central to the field &lt;br/&gt;of statistics, but is rarely used in speech recognition research. &lt;br/&gt;Graduate students working on this project will learn its utility and &lt;br/&gt;how to use it on other problems. Open source versions of the software &lt;br/&gt;developed will be made available for free downloading.</AbstractNarration>
