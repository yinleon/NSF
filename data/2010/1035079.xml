    <AbstractNarration>IIP 1035079&lt;br/&gt;University of South Florida &lt;br/&gt;Morgera &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of South Florida (USF) plans to join the existing IUCRC for Advanced Small Satellite Technologies Research and Education Center (ASTREC) which currently is a multi- university center comprised of the University of Florida (lead institution) and North Carolina State University (NCSU). The research mission of the Center is to perform leading-edge research that is industry driven to produce technologically small satellites and components, which will be on-orbit validated and demonstrated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The USF research site plans to focus on small satellite technology, expanding the research capability of the current center. Research needs have been defined in collaboration with potential partners representing a range of industries. The research team will emphasize system, subsystem and component level research. A strong multi-disciplinary team of researchers is included, representing mechanical and electrical engineering. Institutional facilities, organized in a number of research centers, are available to support the research described. The collaboration between USF and ASTREC will help advance the state-of-the-art techniques in small satellites as well as enhance the space related academic curriculum using realistic satellite projects. The research interests and experience of the USF team both augment and complement very well the research activities and competencies already represented at the center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technologies planned to be developed for small satellites, such as the compact, multifunctional RF devices, would have applicability in emerging commercial and military applications such as biomedical sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles, and could represent transformational technologies in low-power wireless communication. The inclusion of USF in the center would provide access to a highly diverse student body, which would add diversity to the overall center. A variety of NSF and institutional sponsored programs would be leveraged to support Hispanic and African American student involvement in the I/UCRC. Through the Alfred P. Sloan program, USF has 30 minority candidates in the Ph.D. pipeline. FSU has a long-standing, successful diversity program, which will support the planned efforts of recruiting and out-reach to under-represented groups. Specifically, the proposal includes highly commendable plans for involving students in prominent roles at the planning meetings. The proposing team also has a long-standing, highly successful collaboration with the Tampa Museum of Science and Industry that will be utilized in the proposed research site to reach out to K-12 as well as the general public.</AbstractNarration>
