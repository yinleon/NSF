    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: Genetics is the study of how biological traits are transmitted from parents to offspring. For over 100 years it has been appreciated that owing to biological complexities, a mutations effect may vary with the genetic background in which it occurs. For example, imagine the following biochemical pathway. Here some compound X is converted by Enzyme 1 (coded by one gene) into compound Y and then Y is converted by Enzyme 2 (coded by another gene) into a third compound Z. In this case, a mutation that inactivates Enzyme 2 also inactivates the entire pathway, even in an organism in which Enzyme 1 is functional. On the other hand, the same mutation would have no effect in an organism in which Enzyme 1 was previously inactivated. Such interactions complicate the question, what does this mutation do since the effects of mutations in these cases are context-dependent? But at the same time, such interactions provide opportunities for experimentation to dissect underlying biological mechanisms. In our simple example, the observation that mutations inactivating Enzyme 2 have no effect when Enzyme 1 has been inactivated implies that Enzyme 2 mechanistically acts downstream of Enzyme 1 in some common pathway. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project formalizes these intuitive notions using two theoretical approaches, one based on a quantitative model of how single enzymes operate and the other based on a quantitative model of whole-organism metabolism. This work will yield an analytic framework to sort pairs of mutations into those that act by a shared mechanism and those that act by distinct mechanisms. In addition it will provide an estimate of the number of distinct mechanisms influencing a biological trait. This research is extremely timely because recent high-throughput technical innovations in genomics are yielding vast datasets on mutational interactions in several microbial model systems (E. coli, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe), and prospects are good for similar datasets in multicellular model organisms such as D. melanogaster and C. elegans. These experimental innovations thus open the door to far more sophisticated mechanistic analyses. Critically, direct experimental attack on specific mechanistic interactions remains prohibitively expensive, further motivating the present theoretical approach. This work also promises to make contributions at several levels of biological organization, from enzymatics to whole organism reproductive success to ecological and biogeochemical resource fluxes. This follows because the theoretical model of single enzymes can also be applied to whole organisms, and because the model of metabolism can be applied to any network of chemical fluxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Beyond allowing inferences to be made regarding biological mechanisms, mutational interactions have theoretical implications for a diversity of biological processes, including constraints on adaptation, the evolution of sex and speciation. The PI has active research programs in several of these areas and so this research directly complements his ongoing work. Moreover this project directly supports the training of a graduate student at the interface of mathematics and biology, to develop expertise essential in this genomic and post-genomic era. Spin-off projects are planned to engage a number of undergraduate students in research working in the PIs laboratory each term and during the summer. The PI also has an ongoing commitment to the intellectual engagement of Providence public school students and teachers through an existing NSF-funded GK-12 program. This outreach work addresses current cultural barriers to understanding genetics and the implications of evolutionary thinking in the United States.</AbstractNarration>
