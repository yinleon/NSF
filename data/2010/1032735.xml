    <AbstractNarration>A Summer School of Behavioral Neuroendocrinology has been operating successfully at Michigan State University since 2005. The program will relocate in 2010 to Emory University. Leaders in the field will be brought to Emory's campus from all over the U.S. to discuss topics such as sex differences in behavior and the nervous system, the effects of hormones on brain structures and processes, and the neuroendocrinology of stress. Participants will receive training in writing, data archiving and bioinformatics, and the analysis of hormone-dependent behaviors. The course is intended for undergraduates (or people who have recently received their undergraduate degree) who are contemplating applying to graduate school. The aim is to give trainees an appreciation for behavioral neuroendocrinology as a discipline as well as a sense of what it is like to have a career in science. One important aspect of the course is that the trainees interact with professors and graduate students who are accomplished scientists. Following the one-week course, trainees attend the annual meeting of the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology (SBN) to consolidate what they have learned and to expand their social contacts within the field. Attending the SBN meeting is an excellent way for trainees to find graduate programs and faculty mentors with matching interests. A mixture of students who have expressed interest in a career in science will be brought together, and recruitment efforts will target underrepresented minorities. Thus, the overall goal is to increase the strength and the diversity of the applicant pool in this area of science nationwide.</AbstractNarration>
