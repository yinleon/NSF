    <AbstractNarration>In theoretical computer science, algorithms are usually evaluated with respect to their worst-case performance, whereas in other areas, average-case analysis is often used. Both of these approaches have drawbacks: worst-case analysis is overly pessimistic and average-case analysis often rests on unrealistic assumptions. To address these issues, a number of other analysis frameworks have been proposed including self-improving algorithms, smoothed analysis, instance-optimality, and algorithmic design based on a variety of data models. The objective of the project is to continue this line of research and develop techniques that go beyond worst-case analysis in the areas of approximation algorithms, algorithmic mechanism design and online algorithms. In the area of approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems, the project focuses on the development of approximation algorithms that achieve a kind of instance optimality. In the area of algorithmic mechanism design, the PI will continue to study the design and analysis of profit maximizing auctions in single-parameter environments and beyond. In the area of online algorithms, the PI will work to develop effective online algorithms for a fundamental and practical self-organizing data structure problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the development of more effective and practical algorithms and a deeper understanding of the performance of these algorithms in practice, this research has the potential to impact a variety of subfields of computer science including artificial intelligence, systems and networking, data mining, and electronic commerce.</AbstractNarration>
