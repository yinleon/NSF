    <AbstractNarration>This award allows the National Academy of Sciences to provide travel fellowships for student attendance at the National Radio Science Meeting and the URSI (International Union of Radio Science) GA (General Assembly). This project is conducted by the U.S. National Committee for the International Union of Radio Science (USNC-URSI) of the Board on International Scientific Organizations in the Policy and Global Affairs Division. The travel fellowships encourage students at U.S. universities to participate in the National Radio Science Meeting and the 2011 URSI General Assembly, fostering their career development as future radio scientists. This will allow younger researchers to participate in scientific meetings in their field and to present their research to colleagues, exposing them to new scientific developments from both leading U.S. and international institutions, and contributing to their education and their professional development. This is guaranteeed to strengthen the current and future health of U.S. scientific research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The USNC-URSI National Radio Science Meeting is held each January at the University of Colorado at Boulder and is attended by approximately 400 participants. The international URSI General Assembly is held every three years in locations around the world. In 2008 it was held in Chicago, Illinois, only the third time that the United States has hosted an URSI GA in its 90-year history. The 30th URSI General Assembly will be held in Istanbul, Turkey, August 13-20, 2011.</AbstractNarration>
