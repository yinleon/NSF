    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and the Division of Materials Research (DMR) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Jennifer Brodbelt at the University of Texas at Austin for three summers, commencing in 2010. The site will support eight students per summer in a ten week program. The research projects focus on research in the chemical and materials sciences. Sample projects include: (1) the development of surface-enhanced desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry for analysis of complex mixtures; (2) the development of catalytic surfaces using surface-tethered biomolecules ; (3) the development of high-throughput methods for the measurement of reaction yield and enantiomeric excess; (4) the study of catalysis by bimetallic nanoparticles; (5) computational study of structure-function relationships in metallic nanoparticles ; (6) the synthesis of new kinds of hybrid organic/inorganic materials; (7) the development of threading polyintercalation as a molecular recognition motif for double-stranded DNA; (8) the synthesis of new kinds of lanthanide-containing polymeric materials; (9) the development of transition metal catalysts for the direct reductive coupling of unsaturated reactants to carbonyls and imines; and (10) the development of new synthetic routes for metal nanoparticles. In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a variety of professional development activities, and will take part in a student-led outreach program. Students will be recruited both regionally and nationally. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training. This REU site aims to provide practical, hands-on research training to a significant number of students who might not otherwise have this opportunity. The possible projects span a wide range of topics in current chemical and materials research -- from investigations of new kinds of materials with technologically-useful properties to fundamental studies in traditional areas of chemistry. The REU students participating in University of Texas's REU site will receive excellent training on state-of-the-art equipment. Students participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce. Many of the student participants will come from groups traditionally underrepresented in the chemical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
