    <AbstractNarration>In response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill innovative UWB radar sensor network imaging methodologies to produce 2-D image based on 1-D signals are under development. Using these techniques beach soil reflectivity can be measured. The differences between the reflectivity of oil spilled beach soil and that of the normal beach soil shows the dielectric property changes due to oil spill. The oil spill has changed the beach soil dispersion, and oil contamination drastically reduces the bearing capacity of sand, which impacts building foundations and may cause building safety issue. In this project, models of the relations between soil reflectivity, oil content, and compression index are under development. The research crosses multiple disciplines, including sensor networks, radars, geoscience and remote sensing, civil engineering and geotechnology, signal and image processing, wireless communications, and pattern recognition; the research team includes four investigators drawn from three departments (EE, Civil Engineering, and CSE). This project promises to generate new results for radar remote sensing and radar sensor network approaches to assessing oil spill impact on beach soil.</AbstractNarration>
