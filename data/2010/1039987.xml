    <AbstractNarration>Technical Summary: This award enables West Virginia University to acquire a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) system to grow a variety of oxide thin films, multilayers, and nanostructures with applications in physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and health sciences. The PLD system will be used to study the magnetoelectronic properties of multiferroic oxide films on polar semiconductors, the effects of tunneling through active ferroelectric junctions, the fabrication of novel reversible biosensors, new photovoltaic and photocatalysis devices, coatings for biomedical applications, and solid oxide fuel cell materials, among other projects. PLD is recognized as an efficient way of growing nanostructures with desired stoichiometry, but there is presently no PLD system at West Virginia University. The instrument will complement existing sputtering and molecular beam epitaxy growth facilities. The system will not only grow oxides using laser ablation deposition, but will also be able to ablate target material using electron beams, for materials that cannot be ablated with the laser, and will include two sputtering guns for deposition of metals. Additional functionality will be provided by analyzing the x-ray fluorescence emitted by the reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) gun to provide in-situ structural and stoichiometric information. The PLD system will be made available to a large number of students, postdocs, and faculty, both at WVU and at other universities, and to private companies in the region, by incorporating the instrument into the WVNano Initiative's Shared Facilities. The instrument will also tie into the WVNano Initiative's undergraduate and graduate student research, education, and outreach programs that target a large proportion (greater than 50%) of underrepresented minorities and women from the State of WV and the Appalachian region. Because users are trained to operate the WVNano instruments, skills useful for the students' future careers will be developed. The research enabled by the instrument will have impacts the regional, national, and international levels because of collaborations with external investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layman Summary: Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a versatile technique designed to fabricate nanoscale structures with high chemical and structural precision. When combined with other advanced fabrication and diagnostic tools, PLD can be a powerful tool with a wide-range of research and technology applications. Because there no such system currently exists at West Virginia University, the instrument will allow researchers to pursue new avenues that will have a significant impact on the development of future energy and health care technology. In particular, the research enabled by the instrument will result in more energy-efficient electronic devices, smaller and more reliable data storage devices, biomolecular sensors for real-time monitoring, better coatings for biomedical implants, improved solar energy conversion devices, and more efficient fuel cells. The PLD system will be operated by the WVNano Initiative's shared facilities infrastructure at WVU which will make the instrument available to a large number of students, postdocs, and faculty, both at WVU and at other universities, and to private companies in the region. The instrument will also tie into the WVNano Initiative's undergraduate and graduate student research, education, and outreach programs that target a large proportion (greater than 50%) of underrepresented minorities and women from the State of WV and the Appalachian region. Because users are trained to operate the WVNano instruments, skills useful for the students' future careers will be developed. The research enabled by the instrument will have impacts at the regional, national, and international levels because of collaborations with external investigators.</AbstractNarration>
