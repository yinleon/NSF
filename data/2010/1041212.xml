    <AbstractNarration>Virtually all scholarship about public opinion and the Court is&lt;br/&gt;predicated on the view that the media are principal actors in&lt;br/&gt;diffusion of knowledge about the Court. Yet most Court reporters have&lt;br/&gt;little to no legal training and media coverage may conflict sharply&lt;br/&gt;with views in the legal community. So, what role does the media play&lt;br/&gt;in the public understanding of the Court? Do news and editorial&lt;br/&gt;boards exercise discretion in writing about law in systematically&lt;br/&gt;distinguishable ways? What are these implications for the study&lt;br/&gt;of judicial politics? What are the normative implications?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, virtually no systematic, large-scale, empirical examination&lt;br/&gt;has shed light on the foundational role that the media play in the&lt;br/&gt;diffusion of legal knowledge. This project fills that&lt;br/&gt;void by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; -- characterizing how the media, via hard news stories and&lt;br/&gt; editorials, has portrayed the workings of the Supreme Court over&lt;br/&gt; time, across cases, and across outlets;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; -- assessing how media coverage of the Court differs from the&lt;br/&gt; understanding in the legal community;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; -- providing publicly available data and summary measures that&lt;br/&gt; describe how media outlets disseminate information about the Supreme&lt;br/&gt; Court;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; -- providing documented, easy-to-use software for the statistical&lt;br/&gt; analysis of newspaper articles and editorials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is the first assessment of media coverage of the&lt;br/&gt;Court that examines all news stories and editorials on the Court&lt;br/&gt;written by over 20 major newspapers in a 10 year period. A major&lt;br/&gt;portion of the project is the development of widely-applicable,&lt;br/&gt;easy-to-use software and statistical methods for analyzing the content&lt;br/&gt;of news articles. In so doing, the principal investigators are &lt;br/&gt;positioned to address foundational questions in how, what, when,&lt;br/&gt;where, and why the media reports on the Court.</AbstractNarration>
