    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt; This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research will develop low temperature (&lt; 500 degrees C) topochemical synthetic strategies to direct the preparation of new solid-state materials. Combinations of ion exchange, reductive intercalation, and/or oxidative intercalation will be used to build extended arrays within layered oxide hosts. Emphasis will be placed on multistep reaction processing where the sequential application of topochemical methods will lead to new intricately layered products. This program is expected in the long term to contribute to the development of an extensive series of low temperature topochemical reaction strategies where a comprehensive library of reactions can be envisioned that would allow for the directed, rational synthesis of new non-molecular target compounds with specific structural, electronic and magnetic features. &lt;br/&gt; With respect to the educational impact, efforts here will focus on the training of students and postdoctoral associates. Participants will gain valuable training in the synthesis and characterization of new materials as well as the presentation and publication of scientific data. A further aspect of this program is the involvement of international students where undergraduate and/or graduate students from France will work in the PI's laboratory; this effort will serve to promote solid-state chemistry at the international level. Finally, to help promote science in the New Orleans area, local high school students will be involved in this research program each summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt; New methods will be developed that will allow the preparation of new oxide materials. These methods are expected to expand chemists' current capabilities and allow for the effective synthesis of new compounds of technological importance, such as new electronic and/or magnetic materials. This program will also help to train scientists in materials chemistry and general scientific methods. Personnel in this program will include postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduates. In terms of international impact, science students from France will work in the PI's lab as part of their training and the PI will continue ongoing collaborative projects with researchers in Japan. Further, to help promote science in the New Orleans area, local high school students will be involved in this research program each summer.</AbstractNarration>
