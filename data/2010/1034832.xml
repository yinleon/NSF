    <AbstractNarration>1034832&lt;br/&gt;Basu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports upgrade of an existing thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS) in the Earth and Environmental Sciences Department at the University of Rochester. The instrument was installed in 1988 and later upgraded through EAR/IF support (EAR-0732679 ) to support detector electronics and a modern data acquisition system. This funding will allow for additional electronic component upgrades (magnet power supply, filament control) that are failing. The TIMS lab at Rochester supports research and research training in radiogenic isotope geochemistry as applied to problems in igneous petrology, geochronology and tectonics and environmental geochemistry including studies of the timing and petrogenesis of rift volcanics from the Afar basin, geochemical and tectonic studies of Franciscan complex subduction generated magmatic sequences from the California Coast Ranges, and studies of the magmagenesis of Rajmahal flood basalts from eastern India. The proposed upgrade will extend the life of a 22 year old instrument at a fraction of the cost of a new TIMS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
