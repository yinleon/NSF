    <AbstractNarration>This study uses evolutionary life history theory to gain insight into the developmental origins of some global health problems, especially high blood pressure and low birth weight. The research takes place in the Dogon people of Mali, West Africa, who face many of the environmental conditions that prevailed when the metabolic and developmental mechanisms that underlie human disease were shaped by natural selection. The research addresses the questions: (1) Are children who were stunted and underweight as infants at elevated risk for high blood pressure if they catch up to their peers as they mature? (2) Do children who were better nourished in childhood mature more quickly and reproduce sooner than their peers? (3) What is the influence of family size (number of siblings) on growth rates, maturation (puberty and menarche), age at first birth, and birth weight in the next generation? This research stands out as a rare example of a study that follows children in an African community longitudinally from infancy to adulthood. The study has reached a critical stage wherein the cohort (N = 1700) is experiencing major life transitions (puberty, menarche, and first birth) whose timing is documented. To the extensive data already in hand, new data are added including measurements of blood pressure, nutritional status, body size and composition, birth weights, and salivary testosterone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High blood pressure and low birth weight are problems of global significance that disproportionately affect individuals of African descent. The research is carried out by an international francophone team thereby promoting the cross-fertilization of ideas and knowledge. The graduate research assistants gain valuable field work experience and the involvement of Malian governmental agencies and local personnel helps to develop human resources in the host country. To foster collaboration and to educate the broad public, a bilingual web site is also being created.</AbstractNarration>
