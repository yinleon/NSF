    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop and investigate a new low-cost, broadband, RF-modulated near-infrared imaging integrated system for detecting breast cancer. The approach is to design a novel electro-optic two-element phased-array system with high spatial resolution to obtain accurate information about the breast tissue's optical scattering and absorption properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The new imaging system approach will significantly expand the capabilities of non-invasive optical tomography methods. A key innovation of this research is the use of two sources at the transmit side, each comprising an array of multi-wavelength laser diodes in the near-infrared spectral range, to enhance the sensitivity to highly absorptive tissue content (e.g., hemoglobin) and minimize false detection. As a result, the new system is expected to enhance the reliability and accuracy of tomographic reconstruction, significantly improve the spatial resolution of the tissue's optical properties, introduce depth-sectioning capability useful for 3-D imaging, and accurately extract the optical content of the high absorption tissue structures. Significant reduction in power consumption and form factor will make the imaging system suitable for portable use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The technological breakthroughs of this research are expected to help provide the medical community with new ways to detect/diagnose breast cancer at a very early stage of development. Reductions in form factor, power, and cost will make imaging systems more widely available to hospitals and individuals across the world. The research project will engage graduate and undergraduate students in a multidisciplinary environment, support outreach activities to students from underrepresented groups and foster industrial and multidisciplinary collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
