    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I aims to develop an on-line measurement device that will allow cement manufacturers to significantly reduce costs, while improving quality. Cement manufacturing is an energy-intensive process that accounts for 6-8% of the world's fuel use. Despite 90% of fuel use occurring in the kiln, no real-time method currently exists for monitoring the elemental composition of the kiln output, known as clinker. Cement manufacturers have indicated that better kiln control would significantly reduce costs, improve quality, and increase profitability. The challenge is to extract the 1400 degrees Celsius clinker quickly, and analyze it within minutes of leaving the kiln. To deliver this performance, a bulk measurement technology widely used in cement manufacturing called Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation will be used, but with major modifications. In order to do this, an analysis time of 1-2 minute is required, based on 1/200th of a typical sample volume. The challenges are significant, and success would represent a major breakthrough.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial potential of this project will be the reduction of fuel consumption and harmful emissions in the cement industry. Estimates that widespread adoption of this technology will result in equivalent fuel savings from 150 - 600 million barrels of oil per year. In addition to fuel savings, cement manufacturing emits 3.4% of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). When the kiln manufacturing process is working optimally, maximum amounts of sulfur, potassium, and other elements are absorbed into the cement, instead of being volatilized and released with the emitted gasses. As a result, this project has the potential to significantly reduce GHG. From a commercial standpoint, the concept for this product was identified as a top priority by some of the world's largest cement manufacturers. The resulting product will be unique due to the use of a smaller sample size and the faster analysis time. Unlike most other measurement approaches, this technology would be amenable to implementation through a pipe, thereby representing an entirely new product category. As such, it should be useful for many different applications and industries such as petroleum manufacturing, power plants, waste recovery, and any industry that can benefit from real-time elemental measurements through pipes.</AbstractNarration>
