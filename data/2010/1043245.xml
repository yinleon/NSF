    <AbstractNarration>Economics (82)&lt;br/&gt;This project is diffusing proven effective teaching practices in economics to community college economics instructors. The goal is improved instruction for community college students, achieved through increased participation by community college instructors in two existing NSF programs for faculty development that have proven to be effective: Teaching and Learning Economics (DUE 0817382) and the Teaching Innovations Program (DUE 0338482). These programs are based on learning theory research and currently provide a total of 36 pedagogic modules, all of which use insights about the ways that students develop expert-like economics thinking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the first year, alternative choices for outreach and faculty development in the community college sector are being assessed, building on a survey that identifies relevant characteristics of community college economics instructors in four diverse community college environments. Using this knowledge, a planning workshop is planned to bring together economic educators in community colleges with experts from other STEM disciplines that have already developed programs for improved community college instruction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In year two, the relative effectiveness of different workshop modalities is to be tested. These include: a traveling workshop, online workshops, and regional workshops. By design, the Science Education Resource Center (SERC) has agreed to sustain the resulting community of effective two-year college instructors in economics. A participant survey, conducted several months after the workshops, will assess the project's effectiveness. The project includes plans for ongoing formative assessment by an advisory board and summative assessment by an external evaluator.</AbstractNarration>
