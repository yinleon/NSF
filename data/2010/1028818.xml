    <AbstractNarration>Assessing the health and well-being of populations in transition from one environment to another provides insights into how humans adapt to biological and cultural stressors. Under conditions of nutritional deprivation, physical growth is often restricted to promote the healthy development of vital organs. Thus, greater growth indicates better health and vice versa. Studies on immigrant populations demonstrate that migration from war-torn or impoverished countries to the U.S. results in greater growth due to improved health conditions. Currently, no data exist to determine whether similar effects occur in culturally unique African populations. This research examines the growth of Somali children born in the U.S. to first generation immigrants. A sample of 400 Somali children born and reared in Columbus, OH will be examined. Body measurements (i.e. height and weight) will be collected on children 6 months to 78 months of age, which corresponds to the time of greatest sensitivity to environmental stressors. Due to the relatively positive environmental conditions in the U.S., it is hypothesized that Somali children born in the U.S. will be taller and heavier (i.e. healthier) than their age-mates in Somalia. In addition, traditional Somali practices regarding pre- and post-natal childcare are often not recommended by medical professionals outside Somalia. Thus, it is hypothesized that children born to mothers who preserve their traditional beliefs while in the U.S. will be smaller (less healthy) than those born to less traditional mothers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of this research will be valuable in better understanding the epidemiology of health disparities. Further, since this study examines the health consequences of cultural change, it will highlight the importance of culturally sensitive approaches to health among immigrant children. Finally, it will help educate parents and healthcare organizations about the advantages and disadvantages of culturally specific behaviors, both traditional and non-traditional, on children's health.</AbstractNarration>
