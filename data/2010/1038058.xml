    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal 1038058 &lt;br/&gt;Towards increasing the usage of new high-speed network&lt;br/&gt;services by the scientific community&lt;br/&gt;PI: Malathi Veeraraghavan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is high-risk, high payoff because it is addressing a fundamental networking problem which has used "overprovisioning" IP as the primary way to address congestion issues. While this approach has been (and continues to be) used with considerable success, it is only part of the solution; however, because of the embedded base of use this approach, changes to the IP stack or protocol are strongly discouraged. This approach is particularly problematic for data applications that are characterized by long data flows and streams. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal takes a fresh look at going beyond ubiquitous IP datagram services and considers circuit/virtual circuit networking alternatives. The effort will use the Unidata LDM application to demonstrate and implement a modified version of proposed network to show improvements in performance as well as reduction in costs. The proposal will undertake an in-depth study of LDM and its associated Internet Data Distribution project to test the feasibility of off-loading long duration data flows from the general IP network to virtual-circuit options.</AbstractNarration>
