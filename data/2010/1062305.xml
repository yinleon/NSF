    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO), Univ. of California-San Diego 9UCSD). The program will support ten students during a ten week summer research program. Students will be recruited nationally. Funding is provided for student stipends, housing in UCSD student apartments, travel to and from the REU Site, and for a small amount of research materials and supplies for each student. The program will include independent research projects by the students, a series of weekly seminars in marine sciences, and career workshops to explore general issues in science and graduate education. Students have a wide range of potential topics in marine science and oceanography for research projects and access to state-of-the-art facilities at SIO. Students will also participate in the UCSD Summer Training Academy for Research in the Sciences (STARS) program that provides graduate school preparation courses and workshops. At the end of the summer, REU students will present their results during a student research symposium and via a research paper. Students also will be encouraged to present their results at the UCSD Summer Research Conference.</AbstractNarration>
