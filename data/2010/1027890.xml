    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a research program aimed at designing mathematically-informed computational tools for processing large, high-dimensional seismic datasets that display directional structure along lower-dimensional manifolds. The progress that occurred over the past few decades in seismic imaging has largely ignored growing data-related complications, such as coherent noise, multiple scattering, irregular acquisition geometries, and simultaneous acquisition. Computational harmonic analysis provides solutions to these problems by formulating optimization problems that leverage sparsity in a transformed domain. These tools can however not be relied upon for very large scale inversion tasks, because they are not computationally advantageous in such regimes. This project revisits the mathematical underpinnings of multiscale directional transforms with a view toward designing low-redundancy, high-dimensional architectures that should be competitive for even the most data-intensive inversion scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moore's law of exponential increase in computing performance is not often matched by exponential progress in the computational sciences. The culprit is the lack of scalability of mainstream algorithms: the size of problems that can be solved grows more slowly than hardware capabilities. In increasingly many applications, the input of mathematicians is needed to help engineers and applied scientists rethink the design of numerical codes to avoid this curse of scalability. This project is an effort to take a step back and introduce new algorithmic ideas for seismic imaging, the discipline concerned with imaging the subsurface of the Earth. Seismic imaging is the energy sector's main predictive tool for hydrocarbon, water, and geothermal energy prospection. It is at the heart of monitoring techniques for reservoirs and carbon sequestration experiments. It has proved useful to geophysicists who debate the geological composition of the Earth's mantle. High-resolution seismic imaging is also starting to enable the Army and the Air Force to detect IEDs. All these remote imaging problems have by now become formidably complex computational questions that our generation will be responsible for solving.</AbstractNarration>
