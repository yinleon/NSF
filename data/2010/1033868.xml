    <AbstractNarration>1033868&lt;br/&gt;Mittal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop an optically accessible Dynamic Combustion Facility (DCF) that will be used for investigating flame propagation for a number of representative gaseous and liquid fuels, including methane, isooctane, n-decane, toluene, n-heptane, methylcyclohexane, and methyl butanoate. The data that will be obtained for practical/surrogate fuels at elevated temperatures and pressures will be useful to develop a comprehensive chemical kinetic mechanism and is needed for the development of advanced engines. Investigations focusing on flame propagation at concurrently elevated pressures and temperatures are rarely conducted due to the associated experimental difficulties. The objective of this proposal is to attempt to fill this void. The new facility is expected to provide access to experimental conditions which are not easily attained in existing facilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed program will build upon the expertise of PI developed during the design and investigations using Rapid Compression Machines, and will lead to the creation of a novel experimental facility for investigating flame propagation at elevated pressures and temperatures. The experimental facility itself will be a significant contribution to the arsenal of experimental tools for investigating chemical kinetics because it will allow investigations at practical conditions which are not easily attainable. Furthermore, the experiments using this facility will provide critical database for kinetic mechanism validations with emphasis on better predictability at elevated pressures. Since the thrust of the proposal is on the creation and use of a unique experimental technique, the proposed research will directly contribute to engineering science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed efforts will benefit the society and industry at large by contributing to the development of chemical kinetic mechanisms that are suitable for predictive simulation of practical engines and combustors. Such kinetic mechanisms are an important ingredient towards the design of fuel efficient and clean-combustion technologies for advanced engines in an era of depleting energy resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will advance scientific education through direct involvement of a graduate and several undergraduate students. Research findings will directly contribute to an improvement in the learning experience of students because much of the developed techniques will be directly integrated into a newly started graduate and undergraduate level course on "combustion" by the PI. In addition, the proposal will strengthen the endeavor of PI to develop and disseminate an educational program in advanced energy. The program will be targeted at school students, women, minorities and public at large through specific avenues.</AbstractNarration>
