    <AbstractNarration>In the last three decades great progress has been made in the interdisciplinary study of population dynamics combining scientific computation, mathematics, and biology, which cover a broad range of topics in biology, ecology, environmental science, epidemiology, immunology, medical sciences, etc. This proposal is for partial funding for the Third Conference on "Computational and Mathematical Population Dynamics (CMPD3)", to be held in Bordeaux, France, May 31 - June 4, 2010. The conference will highlight significant recent developments in these areas and provide a forum for the participants to meet and communicate their recent work. One of the aims of the conference is to broaden the education and stimulate the research of young and under-represented researchers, the funds will principally support young unsupported researchers (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty), NSF funding will be vital in achieving this goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Conference on Computational and Mathematical Population Dynamics (CMPD3), Bordeaux, France, May 31 - June 4, 2010, is the third joint meeting of the Conference on Mathematical Population Dynamics and the Conference on Deterministic and Stochastic Models for Biological Interactions, with a 25-year history of international meetings. The goal of this international conference is to bring together leading researchers from different fields (applied mathematics, biology, computer science, ecology, epidemiology, medicine, etc.) to communicate with each other about their current work on computational and mathematical population dynamics. The conference will provide a unique opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to interact with leading researchers in these areas. The funding requested from NSF will be used completely to support U.S. participants, including graduate students, minorities, women and recent doctoral students in an effort to provide young researchers and under-represented groups exposure to current research topics and techniques in the interdisciplinary area of computational and mathematical population dynamics. Also, the work that will be presented at the conference will help us to study challenging environmental and health problems, such as pollution, invasion of species, emerging of new diseases, and surging of existing diseases.</AbstractNarration>
