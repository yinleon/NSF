    <AbstractNarration>Through a new STEM Scholars Program, St. Mary's University is providing scholarship support to 24 students, four each in six departments (Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Physics and Earth Science). The primary goals of the program are to (1) provide greater access to science and engineering programs to financially disadvantaged undergraduate STEM students with academic potential and (2) increase the retention and graduation rates of the cohort. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a Hispanic Serving Institution, St. Mary's understands the value that community has for the majority of its students and has built the STEM Scholars Program upon high impact activities. Prior to their first semester at St. Mary's, Scholars participate in a two-week Boot Camp as a way to introduce the students to the university. The STEM Scholars Program, then, includes a Living and Learning Community focused on offering a comprehensive package of student support services, academic enrichment, outreach, career exploration, job placement services, and graduate program advising services. A foundational element of the STEM Scholars Program involves Scholars living in a STEM residence hall, originally implemented in 2009 to provide an enriched learning experience for STEM majors. St. Mary's STEM faculty, in coordination with Student Development, provides programming for the learning community members. The science-designated residence hall also houses STEM juniors and seniors who serve as peer mentors to the incoming freshmen. Throughout their time at the university, Scholars participate in linked, thematic curricular experiences, including a Cornerstones freshman seminar, Scholars Seminars in years 2 and 3, and a Capstone in year 4. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The diversity of the STEM cohort provides the opportunity for the university to assess and refine strategies for recruiting, preparing, and retaining underrepresented and first generation students pursuing STEM careers. Through the STEM Scholars Program, St. Mary's University is increasing STEM enrollment and recruiting a greater number of high-caliber students from all groups, including first-generation students, minorities and women.</AbstractNarration>
