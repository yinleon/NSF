    <AbstractNarration>Objective: &lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to request travel and subsistence funds from NSF to enable students and junior faculty to participate in the ?Workshop on Opportunities for Magnetism in MEMS/NEMS? to be held April 16-17, 2010 at Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL. The workshop is co-sponsored by Argonne National Laboratory and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The transition from microelectromechanical (MEMS) to nanoelectromechanical (NEMS) will require reconsideration of the basic assumptions regarding how best to transfer forces and torques in these systems. In particular, there are indications that magnetic actuation may be more effective than conventional electrostatic actuation at the nanoscale. The purpose of this workshop is to gather together experts in the nascent field of magnetic microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) in order to explore new paradigms and promote the exchange of ideas and methods. The experts will be gathered from academia, industry, and government to review recent breakthroughs, consider the merits of magnetic NEMS and discuss limitations and open research questions in magnetic MEMS/NEMS. It is anticipated that the workshop will generate new insights, research projects and collaborative opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;The workshop will coalesce a new community of researchers in this nascent field. By encouraging the participation of young faculty and students, it is ensured that workshop will have a long-term impact on science and technology. A CD containing all of the invited presentations and posters will be distributed to each of the participants following the meeting. The same files will also be made available on the workshop web page for free access. The organizers of the workshop will seek to diversify the demographic composition of the attendees by inviting researchers from traditionally underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
