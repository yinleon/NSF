    <AbstractNarration>Doctoral candidate Courtney Kurlanska (SUNY Albany), under the direction of Dr. Walter Little, will be conducting research on the use of microcredit as a livelihood strategy among rural Nicaraguan agriculturalists. This study will examine how the availability of microfinance influences livelihood decisions highlighting different factors such as age and gender. The shift towards microcredit as a solution to poverty has spurred an explosion of microlending programs around the globe many of which are targeted at specific groups such as women and youth. Based on an ethnographic approach, this research will study the use of microcredit and microfinance as one of many economic strategies used by agricultural households in developing countries. Through a combination of interviews, participant observation and the tracking of household expenses this research will consider how livelihood decisions are made and how access to microcredit alters those decisions. In addition to data on household economic strategies the research will also investigate the beliefs and attitudes towards microcredit of both borrowers and those representing lending organizations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is significant because it will contribute to a better understanding of the use of microcredit by borrowers and the social implications of providing resources to some members of a household while denying the same opportunity to others. Understanding both the economic and social implication of microlending becomes crucial as development organizations continue to move forward with this strategy as a key component of the solution to poverty.</AbstractNarration>
