    <AbstractNarration>Invasive species are a serious concern for natural systems, mostly because they usually result in a decline of biodiversity. However, we know relatively little about how these invasive species affect other aspects of ecosystems. In particular, we lack knowledge about how plant invasive species may affect ecosystem services performed by the ecosystems they invade. Several plant species possess invasive strains that are more aggressive than their native counterparts. Yet relationships between native and invasive strains and their effects on ecosystem processes have not been thoroughly explored. This project addresses the effects of an aggressive invader, giant reed (Phragmites australis), on nutrient cycling, an important ecosystem process. The success in Phragmites spread has been attributed to changes in the patterns of land use, nutrient enrichment, and altered hydrological regimes. More recently, it has been speculated that its invasiveness could also be attributed to an invasive and more aggressive European strain. Although several studies on the effect of Phragmites australis on nutrient cycling have been conducted, they have mostly concentrated on brackish marshes and/or have not distinguished between native and exotic plant strains. Thus, the main goal of this study is to investigate the relationship between plant invasion and nutrient dynamics (with emphasis on the nitrogen cycle) by exploring if nutrient cycling differs among native plant communities and invasive and native strains of Phragmites australis in freshwater wetlands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential for the proposed project to complement and broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in science as well as to improve the quality of research and research training at Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU) is substantial. NEIU is a federally designated Hispanic-Serving institution (HSI) serving the Chicago metropolitan area, where ~27% of its students are Hispanic and many are first-generation college attendees. Through this project, NEIU will partner with researchers from the Chicago Botanic Gardens and Northwestern University, catalyzing a productive collaboration and broadening research impacts even further. In addition, the proposed project not only enhances research capabilities but will also positively affect curricular development and student preparation at several educational levels. The materials and instrumentation from the proposed project will be incorporated into: 1) the undergraduate biology curriculum to enhance the academic experience of students at NEIU and to better prepare them for graduate school, and 2) into the science curriculum at a neighboring high school of the Chicago Public Schools system (Northside College Prep High School).</AbstractNarration>
