    <AbstractNarration>The various shapes of river deltas were thought to be dependent mainly upon downstream processes, such as the wave- and tidal-power of the ocean basin and the energy flux of the river, but recent work has suggested that upstream controls, such as load and sediment type (i.e. cohesive vs. noncohesive sediment) may also be a major factor controlling delta morphology. The PIs propose a theoretical and field study of how sediment load and type,and thus source terrain, control a delta?s planform morphology and internal stratigraphy. A series of numerical experiments using Delft3D, a morphodynamic physics-based model simulating 3D fluid flow and sediment transport, will extend the parameter space of earlier work by varying sediment fluxes and grain size distributions of a parent river subject to one flood wave per year.&lt;br/&gt;A final set of experiments will include the effects of wave and tides. The numerical predictions will be compared to cores, serial aerial photography, bathymetry, and ground penetrating radar datasets from modern deltas representing end-members of the modeling results. Candidate deltas include Wax Lake and Mossy deltas of Louisiana and Saskatchewan, and El Coyote fan delta on the western coast of the Gulf of California, where already existing data will be supplemented by limited fieldwork, Pleistocene shelf-edge deltas such as off Apalachicola, FL, and ancient deltas such as the Cretaceous Ferron and Panther Tongue deltas of Utah. A better understanding and predictive capability of delta planform and stratigraphy could improve our ability to predict coastline evolution in the face of changes in sediment feed volume and type and changes in the rate of creation of accommodation space due to global and local sea level rise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts Resulting from This Study: The lead PI?s involvement with the National Center for Earth-surface Dynamics will ensure that this work will contribute to the science needed to restore the Mississippi delta and reverse the trend of land loss. This work will also be the dissertation topic and financial support for two graduate students and theses for two undergraduate students. All students will benefit from exposure to a problem requiring the integration of geomorphology, sediment transport, hydrodynamics, and morphodynamic modeling.</AbstractNarration>
