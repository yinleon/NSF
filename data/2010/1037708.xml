    <AbstractNarration>Oglala Lakota College (OLC) proposes to extend and enhance its capability to &lt;br/&gt;deliver the first two years of a Bachelor of Science degree program in engineering. This &lt;br/&gt;capability will be developed through a Pre-Engineering Education Collaborative (PEEC) &lt;br/&gt;established with the College of Engineering at the South Dakota State University (SDSU) and the &lt;br/&gt;South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT), and is referred to as the &lt;br/&gt;OLC/SDSU/SDSMT PEEC (OSSPEEC). The project will establish collaborative offerings of &lt;br/&gt;gateway and bottleneck courses that occur in the first two years of engineering curricula coupled &lt;br/&gt;with on-reservation hands-on laboratory and service learning experiences on the PRR that will &lt;br/&gt;increase Native American student retention in pre-engineering and engineering programs across &lt;br/&gt;South Dakota. A major result of this project will be the establishment of a complete two-year pre- &lt;br/&gt;engineering curriculum at OLC, which will enable our students to enter any four-year &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate engineering program at the junior level. Further, this project will make an &lt;br/&gt;additional unique or radical step in the transformation of classical engineering education at the &lt;br/&gt;state colleges participating in the collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;We propose to collaborate to develop and offer the courses required for an integrated two-year &lt;br/&gt;pre-engineering program at OLC and to increase the success of OLC transfer and other Native &lt;br/&gt;American students at SDSU and SDSMT through shared research, internship experiences, and &lt;br/&gt;community building in the third and fourth years of an engineering program. The project will be &lt;br/&gt;unique in the United States in that during the collaborative process of building OLCs pre- &lt;br/&gt;engineering capacity, OLCs faculty and students will be helping to transform the concept of the &lt;br/&gt;first two years of the engineering curriculum at SDSU and SDSMT. This will occur through the &lt;br/&gt;integration of project based service learning and undergraduate research projects on the Pine &lt;br/&gt;Ridge Reservation, which will involve professors and cohorts of students from SDSU and &lt;br/&gt;SDSMT. Also, these projects will cultivate closer ties among our institutions and OST Tribal &lt;br/&gt;Agencies through collaborative summer research and internship opportunities on the Pine Ridge &lt;br/&gt;Reservation that will lead to the development of future collaborative NSF research proposals.</AbstractNarration>
