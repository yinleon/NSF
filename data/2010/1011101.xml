    <AbstractNarration>Meiosis is the specialized cell division that halves cell DNA content to generate gametes, which then fused during sexual reproduction. Although meiosis is widespread, some species undergo meiosis despite lacking genes that are required for meiosis in other species. Little is known about why some species have lost meiosis genes but not meiosis. This project will investigate whether lichens, mutually beneficial coexisting fungi and algae, harbor changes in meiosis genes associated with this form of symbiosis. DNA from multiple species of fungi and algae that form lichens will be searched for gene sequences. Evolutionary analyses will compare 17 meiotic genes from multiple lichens to determine whether lichenization is associated with loss or rapid sequence change of meiosis genes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By characterizing the effects of symbiotic coexistence upon lichenized fungal and algal reproduction, this project will provide an important comparison for other symbioses (e.g. pathogens, mutualists). This project will also further our understanding of how meiosis genes vary while the overall process remains intact. Aspects of this work will be incorporated into on-going educational activities, including high school and undergraduate student research mentoring and annual public-access seminars.</AbstractNarration>
