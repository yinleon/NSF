    <AbstractNarration>In response to economic, environmental and political pressures, automakers are expanding development and production of more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles. To be highly qualified to work on research, development, tooling, manufacturing and service for these vehicles, components and manufacturing systems through every stage of the product life cycle, future technical staff need to acquire new, industry-identified and desired skills and knowledge. The Center for Advanced Automotive Technology (CAAT) reforms current automotive technology education by introducing advanced power train technologies such as hybrid electric and electric vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles and new generation diesel, biofuel and fuel cell vehicles. Building on past work, the regional Center addresses these issues by providing industry-driven leadership for activities to reform current automotive technician education at the secondary and postsecondary levels. The Center collects and synthesizes exciting curricula, integrates 21st century skills into them, creates web-based dissemination tools and provides professional development for faculty. Awards are provided to secondary and postsecondary faculty to do curriculum reform that infuses educational research and industry needs. Articulation models promote continued education from secondary school through two year colleges to bachelors programs particularly in a consortium of institutions in Southeastern Michigan. The evaluation produces a continuous and on-going flow of information that is used to support CAAT's commitment to reach its goals and ensure its successes.</AbstractNarration>
