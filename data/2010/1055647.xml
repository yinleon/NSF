    <AbstractNarration>: This project will (1) reduce contact of living organisms with oil in the littoral region by binding the oil to OilMaster, (2) hasten the breakdown of oil in the area by microbial activity encouraged by OilMaster and (3) provide a tool for easier removal of oil from open water, such as that just off beaches and just outside reed beds. It is anticipated that the results of this project will provide a powerful new tool for fighting and ameliorating marine oil disasters. Success in this project will also create a use for an agricultural waste product, bovine manure. Terrenew plans to set up a manure processing operation at a large dairy farm near the Gulf of Mexico. This will create jobs and help to alleviate the Gulf disaster, and will also provide a useful resource for alleviating the environmental effects of future oil spills.</AbstractNarration>
