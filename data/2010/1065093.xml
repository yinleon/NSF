    <AbstractNarration>The research topic of this IRES program is an area of astrophysics involving theoretical and observational studies of stellar pulsation, particularly Cepheids. Students from an undergraduate institution in New York State (SUNY College at Oswego) will go to the Department of Astronomy at National Central University in Taiwan for a six-week summer program to participate in the ongoing research activities in that department. The analyses of stellar pulsar observations are tied directly to current models of stellar evolution. Simulations of observed pulsation properties provide a stringent test of the models. Such research is also relevant to understanding extragalactic distance scales. Recognition of possibly systematic effects in the pulsar spectra could contribute to a more accurate estimate of the Hubble constant, a key parameter in astrophysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will also provide cultural and language training to the students to broaden their understanding of the Chinese environment in Taiwan as well as global cooperation in science. This international experience will broaden the students? understanding of the world, especially East Asia, and prepare them to engage with international colleagues in the future course of their careers. The PIs are making an effort to include underrepresented minorities, and the experience should stimulate the participating undergraduates to continue their studies in graduate school. This program should be particularly valuable for the Oswego students, who will come from a small undergraduate school to a research university in a different culture.</AbstractNarration>
