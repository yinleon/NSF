    <AbstractNarration>The Conference Board for the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS) is organizing and hosting a National Forum on Content-Based Professional Development for Teachers of Mathematics. The conference continues and expands in a new direction work begun at two previous CBMS Forums. The current forum focuses on content-based professional development that is related to the Common Core State Standards for school mathematics recently released by the National Governors Association (NGA) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO). The purpose of this third forum is to provide the participants with a better understanding of the features of high quality content-based professional development for teachers of mathematics and to increase the number of college and university mathematics departments who partner with state departments and local school districts to provide such professional development to working teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The forum features speakers and participants involved in the development of the Common Core State Standards, mathematicians, mathematics education professionals with expertise in teacher professional development, and state and school district personnel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference report will be disseminated widely and the discussions at the forum will provide a critical foundation for the revision of the 2001 CBMS report The Mathematical Education of Teachers (MET). The revised MET will be disseminated broadly through the CBMS participating professional organizations.</AbstractNarration>
