    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop an enzymatic bio-fuel cell using a unique enzyme stabilization technology. The technology overcomes the stability and lifetime issues faced by conventional bio-fuel cells where rare metals serve as the catalyst. Development of the bioanode for the fuel cell power supply is based on Akermin?s proprietary enzyme stabilization technology. Such a fuel cell can be used for many lower power devices, including microelectrical mechanical devices, unattended ground sensors, and small mobile power devices. This technology has advantages over similar competing technologies (i.e., batteries and conventional fuel cells) when addressing the needs of small remote sensors and electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of the proposed project will be: 1. that it will be environment friendly because a successful enzyme-based fuel cell holds the promise of replacing batteries currently used in many applications including remote sensing and human implants; 2. it will provide improved power supplies for both remote sensors and drug delivery devices that would be a significant benefit to society; and 3. the proposed product has reasonable commercial potential and potential customers have been identified.</AbstractNarration>
