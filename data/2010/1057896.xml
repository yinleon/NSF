    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program and co-funding from the Chemical Structures, Dynamics, and Mechanisms Program in the Division of Chemistry, Prof. John Wright and his group at the University of Wisconsin are developing and employing powerful new laser spectroscopic probes to investigate how photosynthesis generates oxygen from water. Oxygen generation is the most difficult step in photosynthesis because it requires the coordinated removal of four electrons. A great deal of effort has gone into understanding the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) in plants but its complexity has limited progress. Professor Wright's methods use multiple lasers to create multiple quantum coherences (MQCs) - mixtures of wave functions from different parts of the OEC. The MQCs in turn re-emit light beams that are highly characteristic of the OEC parts from which they originate, thereby revealing details of each of the four steps required to create oxygen from water - key insights needed to develop efficient artificial photosynthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unraveling the mysteries of the OEC will have a broad impact in our society because it is a key to developing new technologies to satisfy our future energy needs. This program's goal of understanding the OEC will provide a model of how nature achieves high efficiency solar conversion that scientists can use in designing new technologies. It is also clear that the new laser methods have wide applicability in many fields of science for probing more deeply into how molecular structure and dynamics control a material?s properties and applications. Professor Wright is also a leader in developing new active learning methods for college teaching, and will incorporate aspects of his research in those efforts. He is part of a consortium of universities committed to implementing and advancing effective teaching practices for diverse student audiences as part of their professional careers.</AbstractNarration>
