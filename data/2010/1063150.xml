    <AbstractNarration>The Renewable Energy Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (REMRSEC) at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) hosts a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site. REMRSEC consists of an interdisciplinary team of 38 CSM faculty from the Departments of Chemical Engineering, Chemistry and Geochemistry, Liberal Arts and International Studies, Mathematical and Computer Sciences, Metallurgical and Materials Engineering, and Physics, in addition to faculty from Academic Computing and Networking; Center for Engineering Education; Center for Assessment of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics; and the Division of Engineering. These faculty collaborate closely with scientific staff at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, located less than five miles from campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REMRSEC has two fundamental research goals: 1) to harness unique properties of nanostructured materials to significantly enhance the performance of next-generation photovoltaic devices, and 2) to develop advanced membranes for energy applications, particularly ion-conducting composite membrane materials that can be used in fuel cells. Over the summers of 2011 to 2013, this REU Site provides 24 undergraduate students a high quality research experience in these areas as well as professional development workshops, technical seminars, and mentoring programs to emphasize the need for further study and advanced degrees in materials science and renewable energy.</AbstractNarration>
