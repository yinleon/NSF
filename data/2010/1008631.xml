    <AbstractNarration>Bruno&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1008631&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops and analyzes novel&lt;br/&gt;high-performance, highly accurate numerical algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;computing solutions of partial differential equations (PDE), with&lt;br/&gt;application to a wide range of problems in materials science,&lt;br/&gt;engineering and medicine. The PDE solvers apply to problems&lt;br/&gt;involving: (i) Various physical observables (elastic and&lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic fields, linear and nonlinear acoustic fields,&lt;br/&gt;thermal fields, fluid-flow) within and around (ii) Complex&lt;br/&gt;structures (photonic or electronic devices, singular geometries&lt;br/&gt;with corners, edges or cracks, anatomic geometries, air, water or&lt;br/&gt;land vehicles built from metals or modern composite materials),&lt;br/&gt;and containing (iii) Fluids or solid materials -- including&lt;br/&gt;composite elastic media, dielectrics, perfect and lossy&lt;br/&gt;conductors, compressible and incompressible fluids, as well as&lt;br/&gt;media leading to dispersion and frequency-dependent absorption. &lt;br/&gt;The computational methodology underlying the proposed work is&lt;br/&gt;based on a class of numerical solvers and surface-representation&lt;br/&gt;and meshing methodologies developed in recent years under the&lt;br/&gt;direction of the investigator. These are Fourier-based integral&lt;br/&gt;and differential solvers that can produce solutions with&lt;br/&gt;high-order accuracy, unconditional stability, and no numerical&lt;br/&gt;dispersion, for realistic engineering geometries including&lt;br/&gt;features such as full aircraft, complex anatomic configurations&lt;br/&gt;for medical applications, complex photonic or electronic devices,&lt;br/&gt;etc. In practice, these types of solvers have demonstrated up to&lt;br/&gt;one-thousand times faster numerics, for a given accuracy, than&lt;br/&gt;some of the most competitive solvers otherwise available: the new&lt;br/&gt;methods can enable solution of previously intractable problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The project impacts upon a variety of areas of societal&lt;br/&gt;interest, including medicine (diagnostic and therapeutic&lt;br/&gt;ultrasound with application to, e.g., tumor detection, kidney&lt;br/&gt;stone destruction, and targeted drug delivery), electrical&lt;br/&gt;engineering (optics, electronics), military and civilian remote&lt;br/&gt;sensing and communications (radar, sonar, stealth, antennas),&lt;br/&gt;design of efficient air, water or land vehicles, etc. The new&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, which in a number of challenging case studies have&lt;br/&gt;demonstrated up to one-thousand times faster numerics than&lt;br/&gt;previous approaches, enable solution of previously intractable&lt;br/&gt;problems in areas such as those mentioned above. The project&lt;br/&gt;also trains graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;associates. Undergraduate students, for example, carry out&lt;br/&gt;summer-long research projects in an integrative environment&lt;br/&gt;involving graduate students and postdocs as well as the&lt;br/&gt;investigator and some of the industrial and lab researchers who&lt;br/&gt;propose specific engineering problems.</AbstractNarration>
