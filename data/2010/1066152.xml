    <AbstractNarration>1066152&lt;br/&gt;Nguyen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a planning visit to enable Professor Thanh Nguyen at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to meet with Professors Karina Gin and Jiangyong Hu in the Division of Environmental Science and Engineering at the National University of Singapore. They will begin planning a collaborative project on the survivability of human enteric virus in surface water in rivers and reservoirs in Singapore. Through preliminary samplings and inactivation experiments at the National University they will study the role of sun light and water quality on virus survivability. An increase in demand for fresh water and the simultaneous depletion of groundwater resources has forced mankind to look for nontraditional water sources such as recycled and reclaimed water. One emerging challenge for the use of these water sources is the presence of pathogenic viruses. Studies conducted in Singapore showed the presence and circulation of human enteric viruses in surface water in Singapore. Similar studies on surface water in rivers located in the Chicago metropolitan area, where wastewater effluent has not been disinfected, are lacking. The researchers are proposing the following hypotheses: 1) the concentration and survivability of human enteric virus in surface water in urban areas fluctuates diurnally due to sun light exposure; and 2) water quality parameters, such as concentration of dissolved organic matter and suspended particle type and concentration, will influence the fate of virus in surface water. Preliminary field samplings will be conducted every hour during the day. Concentration of rotavirus and adenovirus will be determined using both molecular methods and culture-dependent methods. Laboratory studies will be conducted to determine inactivation rates of rotavirus and adenovirus by sun light and to develop a mechanistic understanding of virus inactivation. The combination of field and laboratory data will help develop predictive models for virus survivability in surface water. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is sufficient overlap of interests between researchers in the U.S and Singapore to indicate that they can successfully pursue the activities proposed, and that the interaction will benefit both sides. The Singapore researchers have expertise in virus presence in surface water and virus disinfection technology. The U.S. researcher has expertise on the fate and transport of pathogenic viruses in aquatic environments. This collaboration will allow a better future use of water resources in the U.S., especially in the American South, where sun light is abundant but fresh water is not. A U.S. graduate student and undergraduate student, currently participating in the Engineers Without Borders program, will be taking part in this visit. This project will provide the students with additional academic and cultural experiences, as well as experience in all aspects of this interdisciplinary research, ranging from surface chemistry and molecular biology to water treatment. It is anticipated that they will maintain contact with their Singapore collaborators throughout their careers.</AbstractNarration>
