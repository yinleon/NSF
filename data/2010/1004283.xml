    <AbstractNarration>A new development corridor plan has been proposed (El-Baz, 2007) to help alleviate Egypt's growing overpopulation along the Nile River that entails gradually extending development activities from the western side of the Nile Delta and Valley further toward the west. The Aswan sector is one of twelve sectors in the corridor and is the focus of this research. In cooperation with Dr. Fikry Khalaf of Suez Canal University in Egypt, the PI will conduct a pilot study in the Aswan sector to develop new techniques for multisensor data and information integration for land use planning. The lack of adequate, timely and integrated information has been the main reason behind the delay in developing the western extension of the Nile Valley. The proposed research establishes a multisensor approach for geospatial information extraction and integration from a variety of satellite platforms in order to produce priority maps for land use development activities west of Aswan. New satellite systems are providing improved information on land surface and subsurface features as well as terrain characteristics. However, there is a significant gap between the available information contained in remote sensing images and conversion of these data into information layers that can be used in a geographic information system (GIS) for decision making processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work on multisensor data fusion and information integration includes three steps: 1) classification of the datasets using different classifiers and data fusion techniques, 2) integration of multiple classifier outputs to produce high quality and updated input layers for the GIS modeling, and 3) design of a GIS model to produce strategic land use and priority maps for the western Aswan region. Such priority maps will assist the Upper Egypt Governorates in their planning processes for future land development activities not only in the study area, but also elsewhere, and will ultimately have a positive impact on the wellbeing of the inhabitants in those regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity The main questions to be addressed by this research are: How can we extract relevant information on arid land and water resources from a growing number of disparate and sophisticated Earth Observation sensors so that they can be combined and integrated in a GIS model for use by decision makers? Furthermore, are there ways of streamlining this process (from data compilation to decision making support) so that it can be easily adapted and applied to other similar areas, thus substantially reducing the costs of producing land use priority maps?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Activities Resulting from the Proposed Activity The proposed research involves collaboration between Boston University (BU) and the Suez Canal University (SCU), Egypt. This partnership will facilitate the development of new multisensor fusion and GIS integration technologies that will be useful in a wide global context, as well as building a multi-disciplinary global team to tackle a growing global issue related to arid regions. It also sets the stage for training US students to experience and address global problems first hand. The PIs plan to use the datasets and techniques in our graduate classes at both institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is funded under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to undertake cooperative research.</AbstractNarration>
