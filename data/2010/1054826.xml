    <AbstractNarration>Purdue University is awarded a grant by the NSF Faculty Early Career&lt;br/&gt;Development (CAREER) Program to develop statistical and computational&lt;br/&gt;tools for functional proteomics, metabolomics and ionomics. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will address three inter-related aims: (1) Accurate&lt;br/&gt;identifications and quantifications of proteins, metabolites and ions&lt;br/&gt;from high-throughput experiments, which generate sparse data in form&lt;br/&gt;of mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra; (2) Joint&lt;br/&gt;interpretation and integration of these sparse heterogeneous datasets;&lt;br/&gt;and (3) Optimal design of global and targeted follow-up experiments.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed program is innovative in that it closely accounts for the&lt;br/&gt;biological and technological characteristics of proteomics,&lt;br/&gt;metabolomics and ionomics. As the result, it will increase the&lt;br/&gt;sensitivity, accuracy, and scope of interpretation of the&lt;br/&gt;investigations. The utility of the developed methods of statistical&lt;br/&gt;inference, and of the associated open-source software, will be&lt;br/&gt;demonstrated on functional screens of S. cerevisiae, which integrate&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and ionomic&lt;br/&gt;datasets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed program will contribute to bridging the communication gap&lt;br/&gt;between biologists, chemists and statisticians. The project will promote the&lt;br/&gt;computational thinking, and the appropriate use of statistical&lt;br/&gt;methodology, by making available case studies that are relevant to the&lt;br/&gt;user community, by offering interdisciplinary tutorials and short&lt;br/&gt;courses at scientific meetings and interdisciplinary courses at&lt;br/&gt;Purdue, and by providing mentoring for graduate and undergraduate students across&lt;br/&gt;departments. Materials associated with these activities will be&lt;br/&gt;available at www.stat.purdue.edu/~ovitek</AbstractNarration>
