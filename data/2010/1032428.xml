    <AbstractNarration>1032428&lt;br/&gt;Papoian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biomolecular recognition and biosensing have grown into large fields, with many subgroups of researchers who rarely communicate with each other across subfield boundaries. By bringing leading experimentalists and theorists from various subfields, from protein folding and allostery to ionic recognition, the International Symposium on "Solvation and Ionic Effects in Biomolecules: Theory to Experiment" will allow scientists to exchange ideas on current developments in corresponding subfields. The need for close collaboration between theory and experiment will be emphasized at the Symposium by alternating corresponding speakers. The Symposium speakers will be encouraged to submit a manuscript to the special issue of Biophysical Chemistry, which will highlight current progress in biorecognition and biosensing. The Symposium will be held in the Republic of Armenia from May 17th to 21st, 2010. The Symposium will be hosted by Yerevan State University, the leading scientific and educational institution in Armenia. Encouraging future scientific exchange between Western participants and Armenian scientists is another key goal of the Symposium. Better understanding of physics and chemistry of biomolecular recognition will lay groundwork for design of the next generation of biosensing applications. The organizers will also maximize participation of woman and minorities.</AbstractNarration>
