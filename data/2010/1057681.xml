    <AbstractNarration>Funds are awarded to carry out a costal morphology study on Gran Isle State Park, Louisiana, where undergraduate students will be quantifying the rates of beach erosion and deposition. The presence of Grand Isle at the mouth of Barrataria Bay represents a major component in the natural storm surge defenses of metropolitan New Orleans; but like most of the Louisiana Gulf coast, Grand Isle is suffering from rapid subsidence and significant beach erosion. This RAPID project will focus on evaluating the role that oil/tar buried in beach sand and clean up efforts have on erosion rates. To reach this goal, students will measure the elevation of the beach along standardized transects stretching from the highest point in the dunes or artificial levees to approximately 1 meter water depth along 3 km of the beach and spit in Grand Isle State Park. These monthly measurements and digital photographs will be used to keep a thorough record of the conditions along the transects allowing for a detailed reconstruction of the island's evolution at each location. The data on erosion and deposition rates generated by this RAPID award will be used to inform visitors to the state park and to create curricula materials. The investigation will be carried out by students from Tulane University and the University of New Orleans, under the mentorship of faculty from the University of Massachusetts - Dartmouth and their home institutions.</AbstractNarration>
