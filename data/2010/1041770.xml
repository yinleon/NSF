    <AbstractNarration>Professor John "Mike" Wallace has been a leader in the field of climate dynamics for more than four decades, and his pioneering research has led to fundamental advances in our understanding of the climate system. In addition, he has been a conscientious and thoughtful mentor to dozens of graduate students, many of whom have made important contributions to the field of climate dynamics. In recognition of his achievements and on the occasion of his 70th birthday, a symposium will be held on September 27th and 28th 2010 at the University of Washington. This two-day event will include scientific presentations from Wallace's primary colleagues over the years and a large contingent of his former PhD students. The symposium will cover the current state of knowledge of climate dynamics, and will provide a venue for the community to assess the progress of climate research and contemplate new directions for the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds provided through this grant will be used primarily to cover the travel costs of invited speakers and former students who do not have sufficient travel funds to attend the meeting. Invitations have been broadcast to the atmospheric science community via emails to atmospheric science departments and to Wallace's former students. The symposium will have a broad scientific impact by encouraging the exchange of ideas between climate scientists in different stages of their research careers. It will also provide an opportunity&lt;br/&gt;for eminent climate scientists to educate and inspire graduate students of the current generation.</AbstractNarration>
