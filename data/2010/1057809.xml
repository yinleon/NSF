    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award to Mississippi State University funds the acquisition of a triple quadrupole gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC/MS/MS) system to enhance the scientific response to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and its effects on coastal ecosystems. Reliable and sensitive state-of-the art instruments are critically needed in order to provide the much needed rapid analytical services for various state agencies and research groups in the State of Mississippi for monitoring and biological research efforts in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster. Therefore, an expected result of this NSF-RAPID award is timely and critical information to inform policy and remediation efforts in response to the oil spill. Short-term and long-term monitoring, biological, environmental exposure, remediation, and public health research programs addressing the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill disaster are examples of the research areas that will benefit from reliable, sensitive, and timely analytical support. This analytical support can certainly also be provided to agencies of other affected States. In addition, examples of Gulf Oil Spill contamination analysis will be incorporated into graduate level courses, beginning with the Fall semester of 2010. Results from the studies and education efforts will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journal publications and though participation at regional and national scientific meetings, as well as to the state and federal agencies and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
