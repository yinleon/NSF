    <AbstractNarration>In the context of the recent backlash against native American groups, the researcher seeks to investigate the changing concept of indigenous sovereignty that has been witnessed in the larger population associated with tribal status and the actions of tribal casinos. The research is theoretically situated in a synthesis of critical race theory, consideration of changing economic and political contexts, and the theoretical ideas associated with the law and society approaches critique of the concept of special rights. The research plan is multi-sited and multi-method, including archival research, interviews, and participant observation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research explores an apparent contradiction: as more Native Americans join mainstream society and the obvious socio-economic differences between "us" and "them" begin to dissolve, there has emerged more, not less, opposition to Native Americans and their demand that indigenous sovereignty be recognized. The results of the research will further understanding of how underrepresented communities (i.e. Native Americans) are perceived within US society, and in particular the value perceived in engaging with the dominant legal system as a strategy to furthering long-term goals and objectives.</AbstractNarration>
