    <AbstractNarration>This project creates an REU site around the theme of sustainable energy that will train future scientists and engineers with the skills and perspectives necessary to address some of the world's future energy needs based on biomass. To accomplish this, students perform research in sustainable energy, attend seminars on topics related to sustainability and personal development, and work on a team project related to sustainable energy. Students are required to present their research in a symposium at the end of the program, and are provided funds to present their research at regional or national meetings. Nine students are recruited each year for a 10-week summer program. Targeted recruitment is done to enhance the diversity of the REU participants. The program impacts the REU participants by providing them training in scientific skills and knowledge they need for research in sustainable energy, giving them a sense of the broader picture of sustainability, and helping them develop the personal skills they will need to be successful scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The research produced by the REU students under the guidance of their faculty and IGERT fellow mentors will advance the state of knowledge in sustainable energy. REU student researchers will contribute to advances in the areas of conversion of biomass to fuels and chemicals with an array of processing technologies based on thermal and biochemical processing. The unique integrated approach uniting social sciences, economics, and engineering as embodied in the existing IGERT greatly enhances the impact of the student researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This REU site provides a rich research experience focused on the personal and professional development of the participants integrated with the graduate work by teams of IGERT fellows and Faculty. Students gain not only the technical abilities required to conduct research in sustainable energy, but also become aware of the social and political issues associated with sustainable energy. By being involved in a team project on sustainable energy, students learn to seek outside sources of information and gain an increased capacity for self directed learning and original investigation. This REU site also enhances the participation of students from underrepresented groups in research and in graduate school through targeted personal recruiting by Faculty.</AbstractNarration>
