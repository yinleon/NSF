    <AbstractNarration>1002676&lt;br/&gt;Pikov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Conference on NeuroProsthetic Devices (ICNPD) will bring together international investigators of all levels to Beijing, China in order to discuss recent research findings and to establish new collaborations in the new and exciting field of Neuroprosthetic Devices. The conference will take place on February 27-28, 2010, preceded by a six-week online discussion of issues that will be addressed at the conference. Main support for the conference is provided by two top research institutions in China, the Peking University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University, as well as by the National Natural Science Foundation of China. NSF support will expand the participation of junior US researchers at the conference by subsidizing their travel costs and publication costs for their short papers in the special conference-dedicated issue of an open-access journal Frontiers in Neuroprosthetics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main conference theme will be the translation of the basic neuroscience and engineering research into clinical practice. There are multiple opportunities for the US and Chinese researchers to initiate collaborative projects in the development and testing of neuroprosthetic devices for multiple neurological disorders. At the conference there will be multiple discussion panels and poster sessions to stimulate the attendee interaction. The emphasis will be upon identifying the areas of possible collaborations and seeking to find the mechanism for jump-starting these collaborations, rather than simply to report on the research progress. Online resources will be created at the conclusion of the conference to highlight the successes in initiating the collaborations and to summarize the discussions which will take place during the conference.</AbstractNarration>
