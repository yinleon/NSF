    <AbstractNarration>The Northwest Indian College is the only accredited tribal college in the Pacific Northwest. &lt;br/&gt;Lummi Nation hosts the main campus. Full-service extended campuses exist at four other tribal &lt;br/&gt;communities in Washington and one in Idaho. With grant funds, the College will significantly &lt;br/&gt;increase its capacity to deliver effective STEM programs. Enrollment in the four STEM programs, &lt;br/&gt;and especially the new Bachelor of Science in Native Environmental Science (BSNES) program, is &lt;br/&gt;growing and retention is relatively high. However, the College has identified specific needs in &lt;br/&gt;STEM programs. These activities will increase institutional capacity in the critical need areas: &lt;br/&gt;? Employ one new full-time faculty with an expertise in wildlife biology and develop new &lt;br/&gt;program of study emphasis areas in Native Fish and Wildlife Biology and in Native Ecology &lt;br/&gt;? Begin to offer 300 and 400 level courses at the College?s extended campuses &lt;br/&gt;? Create two new positions to: undertake targeted recruitment of high school and community &lt;br/&gt;college students, employees of tribal natural resource agencies, and others; develop student &lt;br/&gt;internships and service learning activities; create a new student mentorship program; develop &lt;br/&gt;pre-college STEM programs; and identify employment opportunities for STEM graduates &lt;br/&gt;? Add new tutoring positions in English, math, computers, and science that will be embedded &lt;br/&gt;in critical filter or gateway courses and that will also provide out-of-class tutoring &lt;br/&gt;? Provide professional development for faculty, especially on the use of distance learning &lt;br/&gt;teaching modalities and on learning models (e.g., active learning and problem-based &lt;br/&gt;learning) that have been shown to be successful with Native American students</AbstractNarration>
