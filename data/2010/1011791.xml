    <AbstractNarration>The investigator and his collaborators are organizing the 2010 IMA participating institutes graduate summer school. &lt;br/&gt;Additional support from the NSF will enable the investigators to bring in students from non-IMA affiliated &lt;br/&gt;institutions and invite domestic and international speakers to give lectures. The 2010 summer school on computational wave propagation covers three different topics: advanced numerical methods for full wave propagation, contemporary asymptotic methods for wave equations, and applications of wave equations. The part of the advanced numerical methods for full wave propagation will be led by Jean-Claude Nedelec of Polytechnique, France. &lt;br/&gt;The part of the contemporary asymptotic methods for wave equations will be led by Robert Burridge. The part of applications of wave equations will consist of roughly twelve lectures by active researchers in wave propagation. &lt;br/&gt;This is a unique and timely synthesis of disciplines that will position future researchers for the next step in &lt;br/&gt;computational wave propagation. In turn, this will have long-term impact in applied mathematics, engineering &lt;br/&gt;and industrial applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IMA graduate summer school has a 19-year record of excellent programs that have jump-started the &lt;br/&gt;careers of many young mathematicians. Average attendance for these events in recent years has been &lt;br/&gt;58 participants, including organizers and speakers. The 2010 graduate summer school brings students &lt;br/&gt;together with outstanding researchers in an intimate and intensive setting which will lead students to &lt;br/&gt;the frontiers of mathematical research. Students have a chance to get to know world-class mathematicians &lt;br/&gt;on a less formal basis than their interactions with the faculty at their home institutions. Feedback from &lt;br/&gt;participants of past programs has been unequivocally positive. The IMA summer schools are an important &lt;br/&gt;option for graduate students in mathematics as they reach for advanced degrees, and they are an attractive &lt;br/&gt;feature of affiliate institutions' graduate programs. The IMA and its affiliates are particularly committed to &lt;br/&gt;helping to advance the careers of mathematics students from under-represented groups. In addition, the &lt;br/&gt;focus of the 2010 graduate summer school is on computational wave propagation which has many important &lt;br/&gt;applications in nanotechnology, material sciences, and radar technology.</AbstractNarration>
