    <AbstractNarration>Today more than 3,000 languages are endangered and are in risk of being lost forever. Except in extreme circumstances, language death does not occur overnight, but is part of a long process of obsolescence. Languages change as they are spoken less frequently, in fewer domains, and by fewer people. Despite the recognition that language undergoes structural change during obsolescence, the study of processes involved is still in its infancy. Speaking Kiowa Today constitutes a systematic, in-depth look at language change in one language over four generations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kiowa is the only member of its branch of the Kiowa-Tanoan family. It is spoken in Oklahoma by fewer than 100, mostly elderly, speakers. The main goal of this project is to reveal which Kiowa forms are undergoing attrition, the eroding of the linguistic system due to disuse, and which are changing due to contact with English. The next step is to determine consequences these changes have on other parts of the system. The researcher will compare previously recorded data from the generation of fluent 1st language speakers recently passed with "Modern Kiowa" as spoken by fully bilingual elders today, middle-aged second language learners, and young adult learners. The project aims to provide a more comprehensive model for examining language obsolescence. Examining the relatively drastic changes that have taken place in a short time using a multi-generational approach will help pinpoint the moment of "linguistic tip," where the language moves past the point of common usage towards its decline, and will also indicate whether or not tip can be reversed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will describe Kiowa as it is spoken today, and in doing so it will show that Modern Kiowa is not only a system worthy of being described, but the newer forms are not "compromised" or "corrupt." It will illustrate how Modern Kiowa speakers are creatively fulfilling necessary functions within the community today and that the language is still viable and useful. Validating the modern form of the language will contribute to language revitalization within any community by restoring pride to speakers of all types, encouraging curriculum development, and supporting language use in more contexts.</AbstractNarration>
