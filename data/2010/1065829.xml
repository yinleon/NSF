    <AbstractNarration>In January of 2008 the one hour documentary film "Julia Robinson and Hilbert's Tenth Problem," directed by George Csicsery, had its world premiere at the annual Joint Mathematics Meetings. Reaction to the film has been overwhelmingly favorable. The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) believes that the film deserves wider distribution, and this award will make the film available to the public through syndication by American Public Television (APT), thus making the film available for broadcast on more than 300 local public television stations throughout the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent public discussions of the influence of gender on scientific and mathematical aptitude make it particularly timely to showcase stories that defy negative stereotypes. Julia Robinson and Hilbert's Tenth Problem is unlike what is already available, especially since it is about a woman in an era where women had few opportunities to excel at the highest level. And Julia Robinson was remarkable by any standard. Her contributions as a mathematician were recognized as the first woman mathematician to be elected to the National Academy of Science, the first woman president of the American Mathematical Society, and as a MacArthur Fellow.</AbstractNarration>
