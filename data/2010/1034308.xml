    <AbstractNarration>1034308&lt;br/&gt;Ha &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This GOALI project is a partnership between Washington State University (WSU) and Boeing Commercial Airplane Company to develop alternative anode catalyst materials for direct Jet-A solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). There are a number of economic and environmental reasons why these proposed fuel cells are important. The technological limitation to their realization is the absence of suitable catalysts that can withstand the harsh chemical environment of jet fuel. The objective here is to work closely with scientists and engineers at Boeing in Seattle to develop and test molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) based catalysts that are doped with small amounts of redox stable oxides. Previous research has shown that MoO2 offers significant potential as an anode catalyst for direct Jet-A SOFCs because it exhibits a high coking resistance and is tolerant to very high sulfur concentrations within the fuel cell environment. Based on its exceptionally high chemical stabilities, its unsupported nanoparticles were able to reform a real Jet-A fuel over 24 hours into synthesis gas (i.e. H2 and CO) without showing any significant deactivations. This behavior is believed to result from the mixed bonding (metallic-ionic-covalent) in MoO2 together with the high oxygen ion mobility in the crystal lattice. The incorporation of redox stable dopants into the MoO2 crystal lattice allows the phase stability window to be expanded. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research program brings together an interdisciplinary team of engineers and scientists to work on a common problem of developing a new carbon-tolerant catalyst system that will have broad application beyond its use in a direct Jet-A SOFC. The team has expertise in the synthesis and characterization of mixed metal oxide nanoparticles, catalysis, reaction kinetics, and fuel cell design and construction. As a part of the collaboration, Boeing will conduct extensive testing of the MoO2-based SOFC developed in this project, including actual airborne fuel cell tests using its flight test airplanes. The fuel cell performance data obtained from these airborne tests will be fed into Boeing?s existing fuel cell system model and used to refine the model. Based on this improved model platform, Boeing and the graduate students will design efficient fuel cell based electrical power systems for Boeing?s more electric airplane (MEA) concept. Through the GOALI mechanism, Boeing will provide internship opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students who are part of this project to work at their facility in Seattle. The student participants will not only conduct part of their research program at Boeing, but they will also be required to make presentations to Boeing personnel (both technical and non-technical) and will see firsthand how the specific details of their research program have broader technological implications (and how business decisions can be the drivers of technology adoption). Through this experience the students will see that interdisciplinary research groups is the way that industry works. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: In the grand challenge of creating sustainable energy systems, innovations in nanotechnology have an important, and potentially defining, role. Catalysts are a critical component in many of these approaches from hydrogen generation to biofuel processing. This GOALI program will lead to development of MoO2 based anode catalysts for direct Jet-A fuel cells, and will have broader application in other areas requiring carbon-tolerant materials. Successful development and deployment of SOFCs using direct Jet-A fuel conversion will create notable savings in fuel usage and significantly improve air quality at airports and surrounding areas. The broader benefits are therefore conservation of precious fossil fuel resources and creation of a healthier environment. The PIs will disseminate the results of this project through peer-reviewed journal publications and conference presentations. An important and significant part of the broader impacts will be to use this work and the partnership with Boeing to create an educational module on fuel cells for K-12 students in Washington state. All the PIs are involved in K-12 outreach activities and a major part of these activities is to improve the perception of engineering and technology and to increase STEM participation at the college level. All the participants will integrate research done on this project with an existing research experience for teachers (RET) program in Chemical Engineering at Washington State University. The Boeing co-PI will visit high schools in the greater Puget Sound area to talk to the students about Boeing?s proposed use of fuel cell technology in the next generation of airplanes -- the More Electric Airplane (MEA). A project web site will contain information on the fuel cell modules and also the Boeing MEA project in addition to published research updates from this group.</AbstractNarration>
