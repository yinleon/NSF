    <AbstractNarration>Fully nonlinear second order partial differential equations (PDEs) are referred to &lt;br/&gt; a class of nonlinear second order PDEs which are nonlinear in (at least one) second &lt;br/&gt; order partial derivatives of unknown functions. Such a class of PDEs arise from many &lt;br/&gt; scientific and engineering fields including astrophysics, differential geometry, geostrophic &lt;br/&gt; fluid dynamics, image processing, kinetic theory, materials science, mass transportation, &lt;br/&gt; meteorology, and optimal control. They constitute the most difficult class of PDEs to &lt;br/&gt; analyze analytically and to approximate numerically. Building on the PI's recent success on &lt;br/&gt; developing convergent and efficient numerical methods and algorithms for fully nonlinear &lt;br/&gt; second order (time-independent) elliptic PDEs, the proposed research project intends to &lt;br/&gt; carry out a comprehensive and systematic study of numerical methods and algorithms &lt;br/&gt; for fully nonlinear second order (time-dependent) evolution PDEs. The objectives of the &lt;br/&gt; proposed research include (i) to develop the vanishing moment method and the moment solution &lt;br/&gt; theory for fully nonlinear second order evolution PDEs, (ii) to develop fully discrete &lt;br/&gt; Galerkin type numerical methods (e.g. finite element methods, mixed finite element methods, &lt;br/&gt; spectral and discontinuous Galerkin methods) for fully nonlinear second order evolution PDEs &lt;br/&gt; based on the vanishing moment methodology, (iii) to apply and/or to adapt the developed numerical &lt;br/&gt; methods to a number of emerging application problems which are governed by fully nonlinear second &lt;br/&gt; order PDEs, (iv) to develop computer codes for implementing the proposed numerical methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As numerical approximations of fully nonlinear second order evolution PDEs is an untouched &lt;br/&gt; sub-area within the numerical PDEs and those PDEs arise from many important applications in &lt;br/&gt; astrophysics, differential geometry, geostrophic fluid dynamics, image processing, kinetic theory, &lt;br/&gt; materials science, mass transportation, meteorology, and optimal control, the completion of the &lt;br/&gt; proposed research project is expected to have a profound impact on solving this class of PDEs and &lt;br/&gt; on providing the much needed capability and enabling tools for solving a range of important &lt;br/&gt;application &lt;br/&gt; problems which are governed by fully nonlinear second order PDEs. As a by-product, the moment &lt;br/&gt; solution theory is expected to give some insights to our understanding of the viscosity solution &lt;br/&gt; theory, and might be very likely to provide a logical and natural generalization and extension &lt;br/&gt; for the viscosity solution theory which is not natural and neither practical from the computational &lt;br/&gt; point of view. The educational component of this project is to engage and train graduate students in &lt;br/&gt; developing necessary applied and computational mathematics knowledge and skills so that they can &lt;br/&gt; pursue a successful career in science and engineering in the future.</AbstractNarration>
