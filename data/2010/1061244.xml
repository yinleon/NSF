    <AbstractNarration>Vertically aggrading large sinuous channels constitute the basic building blocks of modern submarine fans. In recent years, 3D high resolution seismic data have also revealed numerous small scale subsurface sinuous channels on continental slopes. Recent studies have contributed new insights, but have also led to strongly opposing views, specifically on the helical flow structure in sinuous channels and its effect on channel morphology. A clear picture of intra-channel and over-bank processes of submarine channels can emerge through a comprehensive approach involving carefully designed experimental and numerical modeling efforts and close collaboration with marine geologists involved in the study of seafloor morphology. The PI will pursue laboratory and numerical modeling with primary focus on the following issues: (i) geometric and inflow constraints on the flow distribution at submarine channel bends; (ii) relationships between helical flow, bed-load transport, cross sectional variability and migration tendency of submarine channels; (iii) and overbank processes including grain size distribution and lobe formation due to flow splitting at channel bends. Experiments will be conducted in a 12.2 m × 6.1 m × 1.5 m laboratory tank, and numerical simulations at both laboratory and field scales will be conducted using 3D models of density and turbidity currents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts relate to developing better landscape evolution models for submarine environments that would aid interpretation of seismic data sets by both academic and industry researchers. In addition to this the PIs outline a plan to increase minority involvement in geoscience research through funding of a program that the University of South Carolina already has in place. He also plans to hold a workshop.</AbstractNarration>
