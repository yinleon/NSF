    <AbstractNarration>Coherent perfect absorption, and coherent control of absorption and&lt;br/&gt;amplification in optical microstructures with parity-time-reversal symmetry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A. Douglas Stone and Hui Cao - Yale University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Objective: The objective of this research is to understand theoretically and demonstrate experimentally two types of optical devices based on the recently proposed concept of time-reversed laser action. The approach used is an integrated program of analytic and computational electromagnetic/quantum theory, combined with design, fabrication and measurement of prototype devices illustrating the fundamental physical principles involved. A laser emits coherent electromagnetic radiation with a specific field pattern and frequency from a cavity containing an amplifying gain medium; the "time-reversed" device, a coherent perfect absorber, is a cavity containing a loss medium which will perfectly absorb exactly the pattern of radiation the laser would emit. We explore an even newer device, a cavity containing both a gain and loss medium, capable of both amplifying and attenuating a specific pattern of radiation.&lt;br/&gt; Intellectual Merit: While the laser concept and related devices has been studied for over fifty years, the coherent perfect absorber and devices incorporating loss (or balanced loss and gain) have only very recently been proposed and initial experimental realizations are just appearing. Their properties and fundamental limits, particularly on the quantum scale, are not yet understood. The theory suggests a new ability to use interference to control both the absorption and amplification of light.&lt;br/&gt; Broader Impacts: The new optical devices developed are likely to find significant applications in next generation computers relying on optical interconnects. The project expects to demonstrate the ability to penetrate opaque media using modulation of the incident fields, with major applications to radiology and defense technology.</AbstractNarration>
