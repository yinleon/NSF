    <AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry supports Scott Shaw of the University of Arizona as an American Competitiveness in Chemistry Fellow. Dr. Shaw will work with Prof. Jeanne Pemberton to investigate the liquid-solid interface between a broad range of solvents and polymer materials. The research will use a variety of optical methods to probe very thin films of the solvents deposited on polymer surfaces. Additional work will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. Lime Dang, a theorist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. For his plan for broadening participation, the PI will work with a number of student social groups on the University of Arizona campus, as well as other community groups off-campus. The bi-monthly activities will engage a broad community (age, economic, etc.) in discussions of the results of current scientific discoveries and their relevance to problems in society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research like that of Dr. Shaw is aimed at developing a better understanding of how solids and liquids interact at the solid-liquid boundary. Results from research like that supported here will lead to better devices (e.g. medical diagnostics), better industrial processes (e.g. chemical processing), better strategies to prevent ship fouling, as well as other important applications. The efforts at broadening participation being pursued by Dr. Shaw are aimed at engaging a broad cross-section of American society in discussions of science and its impact on society. The hope of activities like these is to develop an engaged, scientifically-literate citizenry.</AbstractNarration>
