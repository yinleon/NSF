    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of the Photovoltaic and Renewable Integration to STEM Modules (PRISM) summer institute is to address the needs of the emerging alternative energy industry (specifically the solar photovoltaic sector) in producing highly trained and certified technicians to better meet local, regional, and national workforce demands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PRISM summer institute is providing training leading to national certification in photovoltaic solar systems concept, installation, and service. Daytona State College is partnering with the University of Central Florida's Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC) in the development and delivery of this program, which involves recruiting and attracting current Daytona State College STEM students and the regional workforce community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team and partners in the development of the summer institute have conducted a thorough review of existing curricula from the Arizona State University NSF-ATE and SMART projects among others and have mapped the summer institute curriculum to the standards established by the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP), the leading certification organization for professional installers in the field of renewable energy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer institute is meeting the emerging industry standards and is assisting students in gaining employment in the RE/EE field and providing certifications, thus allowing them to move-up in their current fields. Training is heavily interactive in nature. The activity is increasing the number of nationally certified solar systems installers. Additionally, this project provides a foundation for a follow-on study on certification validity. The PRISM center and its partners act as a demonstration site for regional technical training and certification.</AbstractNarration>
