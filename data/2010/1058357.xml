    <AbstractNarration>This collaborative research award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program supports work by Prof. Richard C. Holz of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Loyola University Chicago to carry out fundamental studies on the catalytic mechanism of iron- and cobalt-type nitrile hydratases (NHase, EC 4.2.1.84), in collaboration with Prof. Brian Bennett at the Medical College of Wisconsin (CHE-1058396). NHase's catalyze the hydration of nitriles to their corresponding commercially valuable amides in a chemo-, regio-, and/or enantio-selective manner at ambient pressures, temperatures, and physiological pH. For these reasons, NHases have attracted substantial interest as biocatalysts in preparative organic chemistry and NHase containing bacteria have found some industrial applications in the large scale production of acrylamide and nicotinamide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since little is understood about how NHase enzymes function, a better understanding of the structure and reaction mechanism of NHase enzymes will enable access to nitrile-hydrolyzing materials with broader substrate ranges, higher activities, and greater stabilities. These biomaterials will also provide a "green" alternative to the harsh industrial conditions required for nitrile hydration.</AbstractNarration>
