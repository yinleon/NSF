    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the acquisition of a "High Resolution Optogenetic Microscope," incorporating a confocal microscope and a unique optical stimulation method which will greatly further optogenetic research, as well as other areas of research requiring highly sensitive confocal imaging. While there has been significant progress in the optical detection of protein function, remote optical control has become possible only recently with the emergence of the field of "optogenetics," which employs native or engineered light-sensitive proteins. The ability to combine well-controlled patterned light and sensitive confocal imaging greatly enhances efforts to understand neural circuit through improved spatiotemporal manipulation of protein function. The High Resolution Optogenetic Microscope will also be a large boon to the Molecular Imaging Center (MIC), which serves over 40 research groups on campus and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The MIC organizes a yearly international workshop which focuses on new imaging techniques and applications, bringing together talented engineers, students, and researchers to exchange ideas and information. The MIC also conducts outreach programs with regional community colleges. The results of these research and teaching efforts will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>
