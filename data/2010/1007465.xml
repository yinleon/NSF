    <AbstractNarration>Since 1990, the Southeast Geometry Conference (SEGC) has been an annual gathering of mathematicians working in geometry (and related areas) at institutions in the southeastern United States. In recent years, talks at the conference have covered a wide range of subjects, such as computational geometry, convex geometry, differential geometry, geometric optimization, integrable systems, knot theory, and mathematical physics. By bringing together geometers with researchers applying geometric techniques to other areas of mathematics, the broad focus of the SEGC helps people in each group to recognize unexpected connections and new directions for future research. The conference also plays an important role in connecting researchers in the Southeast with potential collaborators from other parts of the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Southeast Geometry Conference is the only regular multi-day geometry conference in the southeastern U.S. Since the year 2000, the conference has rotated among the University of Georgia, the University of South Carolina, and the College of Charleston, and has involved speakers and participants from a broad spectrum of types of institutions (public and private research universities, prominent regional universities, and liberal arts colleges). Moreover, the organizers have actively sought to involve young researchers and graduate students in the conference. In particular, the SEGC provides a rare venue for new and recent PhD recipients to give full-length presentations(typically, 45-50 minutes) of their latest results. In recent years, the SEGC has also included a poster session for graduate students to present their dissertation research.</AbstractNarration>
