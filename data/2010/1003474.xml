    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Project will develop an innovative approach for epitaxial deposition of high quality thick (Al)(In)(Ga)N layers with low dislocation density. Accomplishment of the proposed effort will provide technology for next generation UV LED structures, which currently require improvements in growth of thick and doped AlGaN layers with low density of threading dislocations and point defects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Al)(In)(Ga)N based deep UV LEDs represent a new class of compact and environmentally stable semiconductor UV light sources. Deep UV LEDs penetrate existing markets that require compact, rugged and environmentally friendly UV radiation sources. This innovative technology is positioned to create new applications that were previously unattainable due to the inherent limitations of existing UV lamps or lasers. Primary markets include water/air disinfection, bio-medical and analytical instrumentation, fluorescence sensing, ink curing, and phototherapy.</AbstractNarration>
