    <AbstractNarration>This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program supports work by Professor Larry G. Sneddon at the University of Pennsylvania to carry out fundamental studies on the development of new general methodologies that enable the high-yield syntheses of technologically important polyborane compounds, polymers and materials. The project's unique approach uses the activating effects of ionic-liquids and/or transition metal catalysts to induce selective polyborane transformations. The project emphasizes both the discovery of new reactions and an elucidation of their fundamental mechanisms and controlling factors so that a rational basis for applying these methods to a wide range of polyboranes and polyborane reactions is achieved. The broader impacts of the proposed work include the development of new methods for enabling the systematic syntheses of functionally-substituted polyboranes, polyborane-metal complexes and poly(organoborane) polymers that have potential applications as medical agents, high temperature polymers, burn rate modifiers, extractants for nuclear wastes, ceramic precursors and weakly coordinating anions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project strongly impacts the related fields of organometallic chemistry, catalysis, medicinal chemistry, materials science and alternative energy research and thereby provides interdisciplinary training to a diverse group of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students.</AbstractNarration>
