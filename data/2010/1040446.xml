    <AbstractNarration>Technical Summary: Small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) are crucial for quantitative characterization of hard and soft materials. However, there are no SAXS user facilities in the Houston metropolitan area, so current research programs require collaborations outside Houston and/or access to light sources at national laboratories. The objective of this proposal is to acquire a dual SAXS/WAXS system to provide the materials research community in Houston with direct access to x-ray characterization for bulk samples, thin films, and solutions. The proposed system is ideally suited for multiple applications, a variety of sample types, and both transmission and reflection scattering modes. Unique features include a grazing-incidence stage to characterize nanostructured thin films, a high-temperature sample stage, and a liquid-cell capillary holder. These capabilities will enhance transformative research across a wide range of federally-funded programs in nanomaterials, device physics, and biophysics that include active polymer nanocomposites, inorganic nanocomposites, inorganic nanomaterials for catalysis and energy applications, nanomagnetic devices and storage, drug and contrast agent delivery vehicles, and advanced biomembranes. The system will be installed in the Nanomaterials Characterization Facility at the University of Houston and will be available to the local materials research community in academia and industry. Acquisition of the SAXS/WAXS system will fill an important gap in the state-of-the-art materials characterization facilities in the Houston area, and will enable continued growth of research and education of a diverse group of students in materials, nanomaterials, and biophysical sciences and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layman Summary: Understanding and tailoring the structure of materials is crucial for a diverse range of high-technology applications in materials, nanomaterials, and biophysical sciences and engineering. X-ray scattering is a quantitative tool for rapid characterization of liquid solutions, thin films, or bulk materials, and the information acquired provides a deeper understanding of natural and synthetic nanoscale materials. The Houston metropolitan area is home to numerous research-intensive universities and active industrial research, but currently there are no x-ray user facilities to support the diverse research community. The objective of this multi-institution proposal, with senior participants from the University of Houston, Texas Southern University and Rice University, is to acquire a small- and wide-angle x-ray scattering instrument system to provide the materials research community in the Houston area with direct access to x-ray characterization for a broad range of sample types. The proposed system will be installed in the Nanomaterials Characterization Facility at the University of Houston and will be available to the broad academic and industrial user base, filling an important gap in the state-of-the-art materials characterization facilities in the Houston area and enabling continued growth of research and education of a diverse group of students in materials, nanomaterials, and biophysical sciences and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
