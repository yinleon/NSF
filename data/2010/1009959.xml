    <AbstractNarration>Biello&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1009959&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Our understanding of tropical meteorology and its ability to&lt;br/&gt;influence the middle latitudes is the major stumbling block to&lt;br/&gt;increasing medium term (two week) weather prediction over the&lt;br/&gt;United States (midlatitudes). The investigator studies&lt;br/&gt;multiscale asymptotics for the partial differential equations&lt;br/&gt;that govern tropical atmosphere atmospheric waves and their&lt;br/&gt;connection to midlatitude waves, extending his previous work in&lt;br/&gt;the field. The three aspects of this project are: (1) The effect&lt;br/&gt;of the climatological flow (the Hadley circulation) on the&lt;br/&gt;Intraseasonal Multiscale Moist Dynamics models of the&lt;br/&gt;Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO); (2) The effect of mean shear on&lt;br/&gt;the non-linear interaction of equatorial Rossby or Kelvin waves&lt;br/&gt;with midlatitude Rossby waves; (3) The coupling of tropical waves&lt;br/&gt;to a stochastic model of moist convection and the derivation of a&lt;br/&gt;closed, single scale, stochastic model of the Madden-Julian&lt;br/&gt;Oscillation. This last project could yield a transformative&lt;br/&gt;development because it would be the first MJO model whose&lt;br/&gt;structure is systematically derived from multiscale asymptotics&lt;br/&gt;(Biello and Majda) and whose convective forcing arises from a&lt;br/&gt;tested model of cloud dynamics (Khouider, Biello and Majda). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The effect of small and fast phenomena on large and slower&lt;br/&gt;phenomena is a ubiquitous question in modern science and&lt;br/&gt;policy-making. In economics, for example, the question may be&lt;br/&gt;phrased, "How do individual actions organize to yield steady&lt;br/&gt;economic conditions or unstable economic conditions?" In&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric science, this question is manifested as "How do small&lt;br/&gt;scale events such as storms and storm systems organize themselves&lt;br/&gt;to affect the mean climate in which they sit?" While large&lt;br/&gt;modern computational simulations have yielded many insights into&lt;br/&gt;this multi-scale organization, they are limited in that the&lt;br/&gt;smallest structures they can resolve are still large; for&lt;br/&gt;example, most climate computations cannot see structures smaller&lt;br/&gt;than 60 miles across. So, the equations that these computers&lt;br/&gt;solve must resort to a model (whether empirically determined, or&lt;br/&gt;ad hoc) in order to describe these unresolved structures. A more&lt;br/&gt;systematic approach is to use techniques of modern applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics in order to isolate the phenomena at each scale that&lt;br/&gt;are the essential elements of this multi-scale coupling. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator's work focuses on using these modern applied math&lt;br/&gt;techniques to understand the multi-scale coupling of the tropical&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere. Specifically, he seeks to understand how storm&lt;br/&gt;systems, which live for several days, organize to affect&lt;br/&gt;planetary scale wind patterns, which modulate over the course of&lt;br/&gt;several months. Furthermore, these wind patterns generate&lt;br/&gt;weather waves that propagate away from the tropics over the&lt;br/&gt;continental U.S. The investigator uses similar mathematical&lt;br/&gt;techniques to understand this wave generation. Improving our&lt;br/&gt;understanding of these phenomena will increase the accuracy of US&lt;br/&gt;weather forecasts.</AbstractNarration>
