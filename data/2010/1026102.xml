    <AbstractNarration>California State University-Los Angeles, partner institution for the California State University Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (CSU-LSAMP)will serve as the site for the 2010-2012 Bridge to the Doctorte (BD) program. The program provides support for a cohort of 12 underrepresented minority students in science, technology, engineering and technology (STEM) disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project contributes to advancing the NSF?s FY 2006-2011 Strategic Plan goal, which aims to: ?cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students in the new cohort of BD Fellows will join the ranks of 80 students (out of the 90 admitted to seven prior CSU-LSAMP BD projects) who have completed Master?s degrees and/or are continuing to pursue STEM graduate studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, project support/activities will include: (1) substantial financial support for the initial two years of Master?s-level study; (2) rigorous course-work selected for each student in consultation with a Graduate Advisory Committee; (3) a two-year research experience under the close guidance of a faculty mentor; (4) professional development activities (e.g., workshops, seminars, conference participation); (5) monthly meetings to monitor student progress; (6) ?connecting? Fellows to doctoral programs through collaborations with faculty and programs at Ph.D. institutions; (7) assistance with applications to Ph.D. programs, financial aid and fellowship programs; and (8) leveraging linkages with related campus and system-wide diversity projects and utilizing linkages with AGEP institutions and other graduate education programs and organizations to encourage program interest in admission of CSU-LSAMP BD Fellows into Ph.D. programs.</AbstractNarration>
