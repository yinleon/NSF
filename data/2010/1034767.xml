    <AbstractNarration>The Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation (SCCF) is awarded an NSF planning grant to expand its collaborative network with visiting scientists, formalize educational programs, create new education and research opportunities, and improve its research and training capacity. Sanibel and Captiva Islands have a rich history and both inhabitants and visitors have a genuine connection to the land and the surrounding waters. SCCF has been the unrivaled leader in southwest Florida in: (1) preserving habitat through land acquisition; (2) removing exotic species; and (3) being involved in addressing problems related to freshwater releases by the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD). More recently, SCCF has also been at the forefront by informing policy decisions related to tackling complex environmental problems in Florida using data collected by its staff and real-time water quality observing network (River, Estuary and Coastal Observing Network, or RECON, a network of nine in-water sensors which provides real-time, hourly sampling of key water quality parameters across a 90-mile area; data and related information are available through its dedicated website, http://recon.sccf.org). SCCF has forged a solid reputation in Florida in the past 43 years as evidenced by the reliance of local governments, federal and state agencies, and local universities on SCCF for leadership, problem solving and scientific expertise. Overall, SCCF owns and manages over 1,850 acres of land on the barrier islands with convenient access to diverse coastal, estuarine and marine ecosystems representing a transition between tropical and subtropical zones.&lt;br/&gt;The funding will aid SCCF in developing a comprehensive plan to guide the Foundation and its Marine Lab (ML) over the next 3-5 years. The focus will be to reemphasize its research and training efforts, including the development of an overall strategic plan to house several multipurpose research labs, accommodate a growing research staff, and provide space and housing for visiting students and researchers. An Educational Center will be a part of the plan, as currently there are no educational facilities at the Laboratory to display the diverse marine life of the area and related science despite the fact that Sanibel and Captiva are among the most visited barrier islands in Florida and adjacent to one of the busiest National Wildlife Refuges. Given the recent shift in green construction technologies and the lack of its use on the islands, specific details and a vision will be developed involving outside experts and examples from other marine laboratories to incorporate and maximize the Foundation's use of these novel technologies into its new bricks and mortar facilities, including using available sustainable practices. &lt;br/&gt;The five-year overall SCCF Strategic Planning effort will include: (1) conducting two large planning charrettes involving broad participation of the scientific community outside SCCF with participants to include lab directors/facilities managers, SCCF ML staff, the ML Steering Committee, SCCF Board members, stakeholders (e.g., City of Sanibel, South Florida Water Management District, FGCU planners) and a LEEDs accredited architectural consultant; (2) visits to other marine lab sites; (3) as well as several smaller workshops on Sanibel both before and after the charrettes to involve a subset of the larger group mentioned above to develop fully the diverse elements related to research, education, and outreach that support the Lab?s mission while stimulating collaborations among scientists across disciplines. Site selection will also be incorporated into the process.</AbstractNarration>
