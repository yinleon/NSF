    <AbstractNarration>Traditionally, networks are scaled to very large size through hierarchy: routing is performed on higher level aggregates and subsequently at finer granularity. The consequences are inefficiency in the form of inflated path lengths, and the use of location-dependent addresses which complicate management, mobility, and multihoming. Routing on location-independent "flat names" can solve these problems and is independently useful to support secure, self-certifying identifiers. But no previously proposed protocols exist for scalable, efficient routing directly on flat names. This project is developing distributed compact routing (DCR) protocols which route on flat names while guaranteeing scalability and efficiency for arbitrary networks. Building on recent theoretical advances in the area of compact routing, DCR addresses key challenges including autonomous distributed operation, congestion, and heterogeneity. The project is applying these techniques to Internet routing, mobile ad hoc networks, and content-centric networks. In addition, the project is studying recent systems-oriented proposals to scale Internet routing based on separating the "core" of the Internet from the edges, providing firm theoretical footing by determining when they can improve scalability with little loss of network efficiency. The results of this project will significantly improve scalability, mobility, and manageability in the Internet and other networks, bridging a gap between promising theoretical results and emerging practical needs. Results will be disseminated through publications and presentations, a public software release, and graduate and undergraduate courses.</AbstractNarration>
