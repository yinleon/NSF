    <AbstractNarration>The application of controlled quantum dynamics to computational problems has been one of the most important developments in information science in the last two decades. This project uses optically trapped neutral atom qubits for implementing quantum logic operations. The experimental approach uses laser cooled neutral Rb atoms stored in a linear array of optically resolvable trapping sites. Focused optical beams are used to manipulate the quantum states of the atoms. Two-atom interactions are turned on and off by exciting the atoms to high lying Rydberg states that interact strongly via a dipole-dipole coupling. In this way single and two-qubit gates are implemented, and used to create entangled states. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work are twofold. First, this research contributes towards realizing the dream of a large scale quantum processor that exceeds the capabilities of conventional classical computers. The availability of such a device would have far reaching impact on numerical mathematics, information security, and problems in the simulation of quantum systems related to the development of new, technologically valuable materials. Second, the research program will contribute to the training of students and postdoctoral researchers for careers in science and engineering. People from diverse backgrounds will be educated and trained in modern experimental science, as well as in abstract concepts that bridge the boundary between physics and information science. Training will occur via curriculum enrichments, and through direct participation in the University based research program. We will also inform the local community about the importance of physics to information technology, and the new developments in the area of quantum information science. Outreach to the public will be facilitated by public visiting days at the Physics department, laboratory tours, and faculty visits to local schools.</AbstractNarration>
